***<-------------------Fast API. when I made global variable employee and empty list[Employee] .. where Employee is pydantic model . now when I am performing CRUD Operations my intention is to perform on this list only .. So now when I add how is it possbible that it's persisting even after execution of the endpoint ...------------------->***


Ah, good observation 👀

What you’re noticing is because of how **FastAPI (and ASGI apps in general)** handle global variables in memory. Let’s unpack it step by step:

---

### 1. Your setup

You did something like:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI
from pydantic import BaseModel

app = FastAPI()

class Employee(BaseModel):
    id: int
    name: str

# Global in-memory "database"
employees: list[Employee] = []
```

Then you wrote endpoints that append, update, or delete from this list.

---

### 2. Why is the data persisting?

* When you **run FastAPI with Uvicorn**, it starts a Python process.
* Inside that process, the global variable `employees` lives in **memory**.
* Every request that hits your API interacts with that same list object.
* Since the process doesn’t restart after each request, your changes to the list **persist** across requests.

That’s why when you `POST` a new employee, and then `GET`, you still see the data—it’s still sitting in RAM.

---

### 3. When will it reset?

The list resets only when:

* You stop and restart the FastAPI server (because the Python process restarts).
* Or if you explicitly clear the list inside code.

So it’s not “persisting” in a database sense—it’s just staying in memory as long as the app process is running.

---

### 4. Why does this matter?

* This approach is fine for **learning, testing, or prototyping**.
* But in production, this is risky:

  * If your app runs with multiple workers (`uvicorn --workers 4`), each worker will have its **own copy** of `employees`, and they won’t sync.
  * All data will be lost when the server restarts.
  * You can run into race conditions if multiple requests modify the list at once.

That’s why we usually use a **database** (SQL, NoSQL, even SQLite for dev) for real persistence.

---

👉 So the short answer:
Your `employees` list persists because it’s a global variable in memory that survives across requests as long as the FastAPI app process is alive.

Do you want me to also show you how this would behave differently if you ran multiple workers, or should we keep it at the single-process explanation?


***<------------------what are workers ?------------------------>***

Great question 🙌 Let’s dig into it.

---

### 1. What a “worker” is

When you run **FastAPI** (or any ASGI app) with **Uvicorn** or **Gunicorn**, the server doesn’t just run in one place—it can spawn multiple **worker processes**.

* A **worker** is simply a separate **Python process** that runs your app.
* Each worker handles incoming HTTP requests.

Think of them like **parallel clones** of your app, all listening for traffic.

---

### 2. Why workers exist

The main reason is **concurrency** and **scalability**:

* A single Python process can handle only so many requests at once.
* If you add more workers, you can handle more requests concurrently.
* The load balancer (inside Uvicorn/Gunicorn) distributes requests across workers.

Example:

```bash
uvicorn main:app --workers 4
```

This starts **4 independent processes**, each running your FastAPI app.

---

### 3. How workers affect your global list

Here’s the important part for your case:

* Each worker gets its **own copy** of your global variable (`employees` list).
* If you `POST` an employee to worker 1, the other workers won’t see it.
* That’s because they’re completely separate processes, each with their own memory space.

So, if you had 4 workers, you could end up with **4 different versions** of your employee list!

---

### 4. Key takeaway

* Workers are just **independent processes** of your app, created to handle more requests.
* Globals (like your list) only persist **within the memory of a single worker**, not across all workers.
* That’s why for real persistence, you need a **shared database** (or cache like Redis).

---

⚡ So in your current setup (with one worker, the default), your list “persists” because that single process holds it in memory. If you scaled up workers, you’d immediately see inconsistencies.

Do you want me to demo (with code) how your list behaves differently when you run multiple workers?
