# ü§ñ What Are Agents in LangChain?

**Agents** in LangChain are like **smart assistants** that can decide what to do *step by step* ‚Äî not just blindly follow a script.

They **think dynamically** and **choose tools or actions** based on the situation. This makes them useful for tasks where you **don‚Äôt know ahead of time what exact steps** are needed.

---

## üß† Simple Analogy

Imagine hiring a virtual assistant:

* A **Chain** is like giving them a strict checklist:
  "1. Open email ‚Üí 2. Read message ‚Üí 3. Reply"

* An **Agent** is like saying:
  ‚ÄúHere‚Äôs the goal. Figure out how to get there. Use Google, a calculator, or call someone if needed.‚Äù

## üß∞ What Can Agents Do?

Agents can:

* Use **tools** (like web search, calculator, file lookup, code execution)
* Decide **which tool to use** and **when**
* Reason through a problem **step by step**
* Maintain **intermediate context**

They use **LLMs to think and plan**.

## üîÑ How They Work (Step by Step)

Let‚Äôs say a user asks:

> "What‚Äôs the weather in Paris, and how should I pack for the trip?"

The Agent will:

1. See that it needs weather info ‚Üí Use the **WebSearch tool**
2. Get the weather forecast
3. Use that data + general knowledge to suggest packing tips
4. Reply with a complete answer

LangChain handles:

* Calling the LLM to analyze the question
* Deciding the tool to use (e.g., a search engine)
* Using the tool
* Feeding the results back into the LLM
* Repeating as needed

## üîß Agent Architecture

Here‚Äôs what makes an Agent in LangChain:

| Component            | Role                                                           |
| -------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **AgentExecutor**    | Orchestrates the agent‚Äôs logic                                 |
| **Tools**            | External functions (e.g., Google search, calculator, DB query) |
| **Agent**            | LLM-powered reasoning loop that picks tools                    |
| **Prompt templates** | Instructions and format for how the agent should behave        |

## üîç Commonly Used Agents

LangChain provides several built-in agent types. Here are a few:

| Agent Type                              | Description                                          |
| --------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| `zero-shot-react-description`           | Agent uses the ReAct framework: **Reason + Act**     |
| `structured-chat-zero-shot-react`       | Uses structured responses to pick tools              |
| `chat-conversational-react-description` | Best for chatbots with memory/context                |
| `openai-functions-agent`                | Uses OpenAI's function calling ability to call tools |

---

## üß™ Example Code (Simple Agent)

```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, load_tools
from langchain.agents.agent_types import AgentType
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

llm = OpenAI(temperature=0)

# Load tools like calculator and Wikipedia
tools = load_tools(["wikipedia", "llm-math"], llm=llm)

# Create an agent that can choose tools dynamically
agent = initialize_agent(
    tools=tools,
    llm=llm,
    agent=AgentType.ZERO_SHOT_REACT_DESCRIPTION,
    verbose=True
)

# Ask a question requiring tool use
agent.run("What is the square root of the year the Eiffel Tower was built?")
```

The agent will:

* Search when Eiffel Tower was built (1889)
* Calculate ‚àö1889 ‚âà 43.46

---

## üõë When NOT to Use Agents

* For simple, single-step tasks (a basic prompt will do)
* If **speed/latency is critical** (agents can be slower)
* When you **need full control** of the workflow (chains are better)

## üß© Summary

| Feature     | Agents                                   |
| ----------- | ---------------------------------------- |
| Flexibility | ‚úÖ High (dynamic behavior)                |
| Reasoning   | ‚úÖ Can think step-by-step                 |
| Tool Use    | ‚úÖ Can use tools like search, calculator  |
| Speed       | ‚ùå Slower than simple chains              |
| Complexity  | ‚úÖ Great for multi-tool, multi-step tasks |
