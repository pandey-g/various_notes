REST (Representational State Transfer) is a **software architectural style** that defines a set of constraints for creating **scalable and stateless web services**. It was introduced by **Roy Fielding in his 2000 doctoral dissertation**. REST is widely used to design APIs that communicate over **HTTP**.

## üîß Core Concepts of REST Architecture

To understand REST, let‚Äôs break it down into:

### 1. **Resources**

* A *resource* is anything that can be named and represented: a user, an order, a document, etc.
* Each resource is accessible via a **unique URI** (Uniform Resource Identifier).
* Example:

  * `/users/123` ‚Üí user with ID 123
  * `/products/456` ‚Üí product with ID 456

---

### 2. **HTTP Methods (Verbs)**

RESTful APIs use standard HTTP methods to perform actions on resources:

| HTTP Method | Action           | Analogy                  |
| ----------- | ---------------- | ------------------------ |
| `GET`       | Read             | "Read a book"            |
| `POST`      | Create           | "Add a book"             |
| `PUT`       | Update (full)    | "Replace the book"       |
| `PATCH`     | Update (partial) | "Fix a page in the book" |
| `DELETE`    | Delete           | "Toss the book"          |

---

### 3. **Statelessness**

* Each request is **independent** and must contain all the information needed for the server to understand and respond.
* The server does not store any session or context.

> **Analogy**: Like sending letters in the mail. Each letter (HTTP request) must include your name, address, and purpose ‚Äî the post office doesn‚Äôt remember your previous messages.

---

### 4. **Client-Server Separation**

* The client (frontend) and server (backend) are independent.
* This separation enables independent development and scalability.

---

### 5. **Uniform Interface**

* REST enforces a consistent, standardized way of interacting with resources.
* Key constraints:

  * Resource identification in URIs
  * Manipulation via representations (like JSON)
  * Self-descriptive messages (metadata in headers)
  * Hypermedia as the engine of application state (HATEOAS ‚Äì optional, often not implemented)

---

### 6. **Cacheability**

* Responses can be marked as cacheable or not to improve performance.
* Example: `GET /products` might be cached for 5 minutes.

---

### 7. **Layered System**

* The architecture can have multiple layers (e.g., security, load balancers, gateways), and each layer has no visibility into other layers.

## üß† Analogy to Understand REST

Think of a **restaurant**:

* **Client**: You (customer)
* **Server**: Waiter
* **Resource**: Food on the menu (e.g., `/menu/pizza`)
* **GET /menu**: You ask to *see* the menu.
* **POST /order**: You *place* a new order.
* **PUT /order/1**: You *change* your whole order.
* **PATCH /order/1**: You *modify* part of your order.
* **DELETE /order/1**: You *cancel* your order.

Each interaction is independent (stateless), and the waiter doesn't remember your previous visit.

## ‚úÖ REST vs. Other Architectures

| Feature     | REST      | SOAP       | GraphQL |
| ----------- | --------- | ---------- | ------- |
| Protocol    | HTTP      | XML + HTTP | HTTP    |
| Data format | JSON, XML | XML only   | JSON    |
| Flexibility | Medium    | Rigid      | High    |
| Tooling     | Simple    | Complex    | Modern  |
| Caching     | Supported | No         | No      |

## üöÄ When to Use REST?

* You want a **simple, lightweight** communication model.
* Your application is **resource-based** (CRUD).
* You need **scalability, statelessness, and caching**.

**<------------where is the state mainted---------->**


Great question! Let's unpack this in detail:

---

## üß† Statement Recap:

> REST is **stateless**, meaning **each request must contain all the information** needed to understand and process it.
> The **server does not store client session data** between requests.

So how does the server "remember" things like who you are, what you‚Äôre doing, or what your last order was?

---

## ‚úÖ Where is the State Stored in REST?

### 1. **Client Sends the State in Each Request**

Typically, the client sends an **authentication token** (like a JWT) or **session ID** in each request header, which the server uses to:

* Identify the user
* Validate the request
* Fetch necessary data from a **database**

**Example:**

```http
GET /orders/123 HTTP/1.1
Host: api.example.com
Authorization: Bearer eyJhbGciOiJIUzI1NiIsInR...
```

The server doesn‚Äôt "remember" who you are ‚Äî it **extracts** your identity from the token and queries the database for relevant data.

---

### 2. **Server Persists Data in a Database**

Although the server is stateless **regarding the session**, it **does maintain persistent data** in a **database**.

Examples:

* User profiles
* Orders
* Application settings

This isn't "state" in the REST sense (which refers to *session state*), but rather **application data** that is always accessible.

---

### 3. **Client May Use Cookies or Local Storage (Optional)**

From the **client side**, you might:

* Store tokens in **cookies**, **local storage**, or **session storage**
* Cache responses (e.g., product listings) locally for performance

But these are **client-side mechanisms** and don't affect the server‚Äôs stateless nature.

| Item                               | Stored At                | Purpose                              |
| ---------------------------------- | ------------------------ | ------------------------------------ |
| **Authentication Token**           | Client ‚Üí sent in request | Identify the user per request        |
| **Session Data (state)**           | **Not stored** on server | Each request must be self-contained  |
| **Persistent Data (e.g., orders)** | Server-side DB           | Application data, not session state  |
| **Cookies / Cache**                | Client                   | Optional optimization on client side |

## üß† Analogy: REST as a Passport Check

Imagine you‚Äôre going through airport security:

* Each time you approach a gate, you must **show your passport and boarding pass** (token + request).
* The guard doesn‚Äôt remember you from earlier.
* They verify the documents and then query the database (flight list) to let you in.

That‚Äôs how REST works ‚Äî every request must be **fully self-descriptive**.
