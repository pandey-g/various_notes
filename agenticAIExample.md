Can you create a small AI agentic health application? using LangGraph? I mean, it should be a basic one. I know you have token limit, but can you help me with code to start with and also provide the archtecture .



Absolutely! Let’s walk through a **basic agentic health assistant** built using **LangGraph**. It will simulate an LLM-powered agent that:

* Accepts user symptoms
* Plans steps like checking known conditions
* Suggests basic health advice
* Loops through reflection to verify if more symptoms are needed

## 🏗️ Architecture Overview

### 🔁 Agent Loop in LangGraph

```text

       |                        |

| Health Recommender| <--| Reflect & Retry     |
+------------------+     +---------------------+
       |
       v
   Final Advice
```

## 📦 LangGraph Setup (Core Components)

We’ll build 3 main nodes:

* `collect_symptoms` – Takes input from user
* `evaluate_symptoms` – Uses LLM to identify possible causes
* `recommendation` – Suggests advice or next steps
* `reflect` – Decides whether to loop again or exit

## 🧪 Requirements

Install:

```bash
pip install langgraph langchain openai
```

---

## 🚀 Starter Code (Minimal Example)

```python
from langgraph.graph import StateGraph, END
from langchain.chat_models import ChatOpenAI
from langchain.schema import SystemMessage, HumanMessage
from langchain.tools import tool
import os

# Set OpenAI key
os.environ["OPENAI_API_KEY"] = "your-api-key"

llm = ChatOpenAI(model="gpt-4", temperature=0.5)

# -----------------------
# 1. State definition
# -----------------------
class HealthAgentState(dict):
    """Dict-based state holding user input and AI-generated analysis"""
    pass

# -----------------------
# 2. Nodes
# -----------------------

def collect_symptoms(state: HealthAgentState):
    return {"symptoms": state.get("symptoms", "")}

def evaluate_symptoms(state: HealthAgentState):
    symptoms = state["symptoms"]
    messages = [
        SystemMessage(content="You're a medical assistant. Analyze symptoms and return likely conditions."),
        HumanMessage(content=f"Symptoms: {symptoms}")
    ]
    result = llm(messages)
    return {"analysis": result.content}

def health_recommendation(state: HealthAgentState):
    analysis = state["analysis"]
    messages = [
        SystemMessage(content="You are a health advisor. Based on this analysis, suggest advice or next steps."),
        HumanMessage(content=f"Analysis: {analysis}")
    ]
    result = llm(messages)
    return {"advice": result.content}

def reflect(state: HealthAgentState):
    advice = state["advice"]
    messages = [
        SystemMessage(content="You're a self-reflective agent. Decide: 'done' or 'continue asking symptoms'?"),
        HumanMessage(content=f"Advice so far: {advice}")
    ]
    decision = llm(messages).content.lower()
    if "done" in decision:
        return "end"
    else:
        return "ask_again"

# -----------------------
# 3. LangGraph Build
# -----------------------

builder = StateGraph(HealthAgentState)

builder.add_node("collect", collect_symptoms)
builder.add_node("evaluate", evaluate_symptoms)
builder.add_node("recommend", health_recommendation)
builder.add_node("reflect", reflect)

# Transitions
builder.set_entry_point("collect")
builder.add_edge("collect", "evaluate")
builder.add_edge("evaluate", "recommend")
builder.add_edge("recommend", "reflect")
builder.add_conditional_edges("reflect", {
    "ask_again": "collect",
    "end": END
})

graph = builder.compile()

# -----------------------
# 4. Run it
# -----------------------

if __name__ == "__main__":
    user_symptoms = input("Enter your symptoms: ")
    state = {"symptoms": user_symptoms}
    final_state = graph.invoke(state)
    print("\nFinal Recommendation:\n")
    print(final_state.get("advice"))
```

## 🧠 What’s Agentic Here?

* The loop: the agent evaluates symptoms, gives advice, and **reflects** on whether it's ready to stop or needs more info.
* It uses **state memory** to keep track of symptoms and results.
* It has **goal-directed behavior**: Help the user get useful health guidance.

---

## 🛠️ Possible Extensions

* Add a **Tool** to fetch real-time health articles (LangChain tool)
* Store patient history in a **vector DB**
* Create a **multi-agent setup** (e.g., Diagnosis Agent + Diet Agent)
* Add **FastAPI** frontend for interaction

Would you like:

1. A version using LangGraph + FastAPI?
2. A multi-agent CrewAI variant?
3. A Jupyter notebook version?

Let me know and I’ll tailor the full setup.
