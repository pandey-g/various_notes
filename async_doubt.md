No you didn't get my second statement correct . what I ment was , see the below fun:

async def fun():
    print("first line")
    async.sleep(2)
    print("second line")

asyncio.run(fun())
print("hello world!!")

In the above case the output would be first line --> pausing for two seconds --> second line and only then hello world! so above calling for asyncio.sleep(2) is stoping my entire code to execute the lines after you call asyncio.run(fun()) so there is no concurrency ? beacause from what i understand concurrency is about switiching between tasks and not running them in paralle ? Do I make any sense now ?

Ah! Yes, now I fully understand what you're asking — and your question **makes perfect sense**. Let's go deep into this and clarify everything precisely.

---

## ✅ What You're Observing

You're saying:

```python
import asyncio

async def fun():
    print("first line")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("second line")

asyncio.run(fun())
print("hello world!!")
```

### 💡 Output:

```
first line
[pauses 2 seconds...]
second line
hello world!!
```

And you're asking:

> Why does `hello world!!` wait for the async function to complete before it prints? Isn't concurrency supposed to switch between tasks?

---

## ✅ Answer: Yes, This is Expected — and You’re Right

Let’s break this down clearly:

---

## 🔄 `asyncio.run(fun())` **blocks until `fun()` finishes**

* It **starts the event loop**, runs your coroutine (`fun()`), and **waits until it's fully done**.
* So **nothing after `asyncio.run(...)` will run** until that whole async call completes.

### 🔁 Think of it like:

```python
# Pseudocode
start event loop
run `fun()` inside it
block until `fun()` is done
end event loop
print("hello world!!")
```

So you're **not wrong at all** — this is **not concurrent execution of the lines after `asyncio.run(...)`**, because:

* `asyncio.run()` runs everything inside an **event loop**.
* But **the code that comes after it (like `print("hello world!!")`) is outside** the event loop.
* So we wait for `asyncio.run()` to finish before executing anything else.

---

## 💡 So, Where Does Concurrency Happen Then?

Concurrency **does not** happen automatically across `asyncio.run()` and your global (sync) code.

### Concurrency only happens **inside the event loop** — between multiple coroutines.

To demonstrate **true concurrency**, you need **multiple async tasks inside the event loop**.

---

### ✅ Correct Example: Concurrent Tasks

```python
import asyncio

async def task1():
    print("Task 1 Start")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)
    print("Task 1 End")

async def task2():
    print("Task 2 Start")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Task 2 End")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(task1(), task2())

asyncio.run(main())
```

### 🟢 Output:

```
Task 1 Start
Task 2 Start
[1 sec...]
Task 2 End
[1 more sec...]
Task 1 End
```

This is **concurrent execution** — both tasks start, and the event loop switches between them while they "sleep".

---

## 🧠 Let’s Rephrase Your Original Statement 2

Original:

> “Anything other than things present outside the event loop don't work”

Now that we understand what you meant, the correct rephrasing would be:

### ✅ Correct Rephrasing:

> Code **after `asyncio.run()` won't execute until the async function is complete**, because `asyncio.run()` blocks the current thread.
> Concurrency only happens **within** the async world (inside the event loop), not between async and normal sync code at the top level.

---

## ✅ Summary

| Concept                       | Explanation                                                                                                |
| ----------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `asyncio.run(coro)`           | Runs `coro` inside an event loop and **waits for it to finish** before continuing.                         |
| Code after `asyncio.run(...)` | **Won’t run** until the coroutine is finished.                                                             |
| Concurrency in async          | Happens **inside** the event loop, between coroutines that `await`.                                        |
| Parallelism vs concurrency    | Concurrency is about **switching between tasks**, not running at the exact same time (that's parallelism). |

---

Would you like a demo where you **run multiple tasks and see concurrency clearly**, even with streaming or file access?


***<-------------------------------Can you give me a real life example where async functions shows concurrency , don't use gather. and guide me when to use async .------------------------------------------------------------------------------->***

Absolutely! Let’s go step-by-step:

---

## ✅ Real-Life Example: **Concurrent Web Requests Without `gather()`**

Let’s say you’re building a **web scraper** or a **dashboard** that calls 3 different APIs:

* You want to fetch:

  * Weather from API A
  * News from API B
  * Currency rates from API C

You want all 3 requests to happen **at the same time** (concurrently) — **not one after the other**.

---

### 🔧 Step-by-Step Async Version Without `gather()`

We’ll launch multiple coroutines using **`create_task()`**, which schedules them in the event loop.

```python
import asyncio
import httpx

async def fetch_weather():
    print("Fetching weather...")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # simulate delay
    print("Got weather")
    return {"weather": "sunny"}

async def fetch_news():
    print("Fetching news...")
    await asyncio.sleep(3)
    print("Got news")
    return {"news": "Python is awesome!"}

async def fetch_rates():
    print("Fetching currency rates...")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Got rates")
    return {"rates": "1 USD = 83 INR"}

async def main():
    # Launch all 3 tasks concurrently
    t1 = asyncio.create_task(fetch_weather())
    t2 = asyncio.create_task(fetch_news())
    t3 = asyncio.create_task(fetch_rates())

    # Now, we await them one by one — but all are already running concurrently!
    weather = await t1
    news = await t2
    rates = await t3

    print("\nFinal combined result:")
    print(weather, news, rates)

asyncio.run(main())
```

---

### ⏱ Output (Timings in parallel):

```
Fetching weather...
Fetching news...
Fetching currency rates...
Got rates
Got weather
Got news

Final combined result:
{'weather': 'sunny'} {'news': 'Python is awesome!'} {'rates': '1 USD = 83 INR'}
```

**⏱ Total time:** \~3 seconds (not 6!)

Each task runs **concurrently**, and the event loop **switches between them** when they hit `await`.

---

## ✅ When Should You Use Async?

Use `async` when:

| Situation                         | Reason to Use Async                                               |
| --------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------------------------- |
| ✅ Calling external APIs           | Network-bound I/O, doesn’t block other tasks                      |
| ✅ Reading/Writing files           | Use libraries like `aiofiles` for non-blocking disk I/O           |
| ✅ DB queries (async drivers)      | Async DB clients let you handle more traffic with fewer threads   |
| ✅ Streaming data (e.g., chat)     | Stream responses in real time without blocking others             |
| ✅ Web server (FastAPI, Starlette) | Async endpoints = high concurrency, better performance under load |
| ❌ Heavy CPU tasks                 | **Don’t use async** — use multiprocessing or threads instead      |

---

## ❌ When **NOT** to Use Async

| Situation                                              | Better Alternative                               |
| ------------------------------------------------------ | ------------------------------------------------ |
| 🔧 CPU-intensive tasks (ML, math, image processing)    | `multiprocessing` or `threading`                 |
| 🔧 Synchronous libraries (e.g., `requests`, `pymongo`) | Use as-is or switch to async-compatible versions |

---

## ✅ Golden Rule

> **If your task waits on something external** (like a network, disk, or database) → **use `async`**.

> **If your task uses the CPU heavily** (like loops or processing) → **don't use `async`**, use multiprocessing or threads.

---

Would you like me to show this same example with FastAPI and how `async def` endpoint helps with concurrent client requests?
