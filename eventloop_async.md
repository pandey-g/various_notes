The **event loop** is the **heart of asynchronous programming** in Python (and other async runtimes like Node.js). It’s what allows Python to handle **concurrent tasks** without needing multiple threads or processes.

---

## 🧠 What is the Event Loop?

The **event loop** is a mechanism that:

1. **Watches for events** (like I/O readiness, timers, completed async tasks).
2. **Dispatches callbacks** or resumes async functions (coroutines) when they're ready.
3. Keeps cycling (looping) over tasks **until all are done**.

It’s part of the `asyncio` framework.

---

### 🔁 Simple Analogy: The Restaurant Waiter 🍽️

Imagine a single waiter (your event loop) handling multiple tables.

#### 🧍 Synchronous version:

* The waiter takes one table’s order, goes to the kitchen, waits until it's ready, serves it, then moves to the next table.
* Each table waits longer.

#### 🔄 Asynchronous version (event loop):

* The waiter takes Table 1’s order, sends it to the kitchen (non-blocking).
* While Table 1’s food is cooking, they take orders from Table 2, 3, etc.
* As soon as the kitchen says "Table 1 is ready," the waiter serves it.
* The waiter never idles. Tasks (tables) are rotated efficiently.

**The waiter = event loop**
**Tables = async tasks**
**Kitchen = external I/O (e.g., disk, network)**

---

### 🧪 Code Example (What Happens Behind the Scenes)

```python
import asyncio

async def cook(order):
    print(f"Started cooking {order}")
    await asyncio.sleep(2)  # simulates cooking time
    print(f"Finished {order}")
    return order

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(
        cook("Pasta"),
        cook("Pizza"),
        cook("Salad")
    )

asyncio.run(main())
```

#### Output:

```
Started cooking Pasta
Started cooking Pizza
Started cooking Salad
Finished Pasta
Finished Pizza
Finished Salad
```

All tasks **start immediately** and **finish independently** after 2 seconds. No blocking.

---

### 🧬 Internals: How It Works

* The event loop maintains a **task queue**.
* Each `await` tells the event loop: "Pause me here, do something else."
* When the awaited thing (like `asyncio.sleep`) finishes, the loop resumes the task.
* It checks **which tasks are ready** (e.g., I/O complete, timers expired), then **executes them one by one** in micro-steps.

---

### 🔄 Event Loop Lifecycle

1. Create or fetch a loop: `asyncio.get_event_loop()` or `asyncio.run(...)`.
2. Submit tasks or coroutines.
3. Loop keeps:

   * Checking which task can proceed.
   * Running their next bit.
   * Pausing them again at `await`.
4. Exits when no more tasks left.

---

### ⚠️ Event Loop Is Single-Threaded

* One thing runs **at a time** — no parallelism.
* But it’s **concurrent**: efficiently switches between I/O-waiting tasks.

For CPU-bound work, you still need threads or processes (`concurrent.futures`, `multiprocessing`).

Let me know if you want to see how it compares to threading or multiprocessing!


**-----------------what starts event loop--------------------**

Great follow-up! The **event loop does *not*** start **just because it sees `await`** — let me explain precisely **when it starts** and how `await` fits in.

---

## 🧠 TL;DR:

The **event loop starts** when you explicitly **run it** — e.g., by calling:

```python
asyncio.run(main())  # ✅ Starts the event loop
```

> `await` is a **keyword** that *tells the event loop* where a coroutine should pause — but **doesn't start** the loop itself.

---

## 🛠 Execution Flow: What Actually Happens

### Step-by-step:

```python
import asyncio

async def say_hello():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Hello!")

async def main():
    await say_hello()

asyncio.run(main())  # <- THIS starts the event loop
```

### What happens:

1. Python loads the file.
2. It sees the definitions of `say_hello()` and `main()` — but doesn’t run them yet.
3. It hits `asyncio.run(main())`:

   * This **starts the event loop**.
   * It runs `main()` as a **coroutine** inside the loop.
4. Inside `main()`, it hits `await say_hello()`:

   * The event loop runs `say_hello()` until it hits `await asyncio.sleep(1)`.
   * Now it **suspends** `say_hello()` and sets a timer for 1 second.
   * The event loop can do other things in the meantime (if there are other tasks).
5. After 1 second, `say_hello()` resumes.
6. `"Hello!"` is printed.
7. When all coroutines are done, the event loop stops.

---

## 💡 So to be clear:

| Thing                      | What it does                                                   |
| -------------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `async def`                | Defines a coroutine (like a recipe, not cooked yet)            |
| `await`                    | Says: "pause me here and resume when this is ready"            |
| `asyncio.run()`            | 🚨 Starts the event loop and runs the coroutine inside it      |
| `asyncio.get_event_loop()` | Manually fetches or creates a loop (for lower-level use cases) |

---

## 🧪 Why doesn't `await` start the loop?

Because `await` **only makes sense inside a coroutine**, and a coroutine must be **executed by an event loop**. So until something (like `asyncio.run()`) kicks it off, `await` is just a marker.

---

### ❌ Example: This won't work

```python
async def greet():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

greet()  # ❌ does nothing — it's just a coroutine object, not running
```

To run it:

```python
asyncio.run(greet())  # ✅ Now it runs
```

Let me know if you'd like a visual animation (step-by-step) of how coroutines get suspended and resumed by the event loop!


***<---------------while using async function in python what if two functions are available to execute at the same time how does even loop handles it ?(new question)------------------->***

# How the Python Event Loop Handles Concurrent Ready Async Functions

When two async functions are both ready to execute at the same time in Python's asyncio event loop, here's what happens:

## Scheduling Behavior

1. **Non-Preemptive Scheduling**: The event loop runs one coroutine at a time until it voluntarily yields control (with `await`).

2. **Ready Queue**: When multiple coroutines are ready (not awaiting anything), they're placed in a FIFO (First-In-First-Out) queue by default.

## Execution Order

- The event loop will:
  1. Pick the first coroutine that became ready from the queue
  2. Execute it until it hits an `await` expression
  3. When that coroutine yields control, the event loop checks the queue again
  4. Picks the next ready coroutine (which might be the second one that was ready earlier)

## Example Scenario

```python
import asyncio

async def task1():
    print("Task 1 started")
    await asyncio.sleep(0)  # Yield control
    print("Task 1 continued")

async def task2():
    print("Task 2 started")
    await asyncio.sleep(0)  # Yield control
    print("Task 2 continued")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(task1(), task2())

asyncio.run(main())
```

Output would typically be:
```
Task 1 started
Task 2 started
Task 1 continued
Task 2 continued
```

## Key Points

- **No True Parallelism**: Only one coroutine executes at a time in a single-threaded event loop
- **Cooperative Multitasking**: Coroutines must yield control explicitly via `await`
- **Fairness**: The default scheduler tries to be fair by cycling through ready tasks
- **Customization**: You can implement different scheduling policies by subclassing the event loop

The event loop ensures all ready tasks get CPU time while maintaining the single-threaded execution model of Python asyncio.


***<-----------------in above case you gave sleep(0) then why does it waits ? it should execute next lie ?(new question)------------------->***

You're absolutely right to question this behavior! Let me clarify what's happening with `await asyncio.sleep(0)` and why the execution switches between tasks.

## The Magic of `await asyncio.sleep(0)`

When you use `await asyncio.sleep(0)`, you're essentially saying: "I voluntarily yield control back to the event loop, but please put me back in the queue to resume immediately (after 0 seconds)."

### What Actually Happens:

1. **Task 1 starts** and hits `await asyncio.sleep(0)`
2. This **yields control** to the event loop
3. The event loop sees:
   - Task 1 is now waiting (for 0 seconds)
   - Task 2 is ready to run
4. **Task 2 starts** and hits its own `await asyncio.sleep(0)`
5. Again yields control to the event loop
6. Now the event loop checks:
   - Task 1's sleep(0) has "expired" (0 seconds passed)
   - Task 2's sleep(0) has also "expired"
7. It resumes them in the order they were scheduled (typically FIFO)

## Why Doesn't It Continue Immediately?

The key insight is that `await` always means "yield control to the event loop". Even with `sleep(0)`, you're still telling Python:

1. "I'm pausing this coroutine"
2. "Please check if there's anything else to do"
3. "Put me back in the queue to resume"

## Demonstration

Here's a modified example that makes this clearer:

```python
import asyncio

async def task1():
    print("Task 1 started")
    await asyncio.sleep(0)
    print("Task 1 after first yield")
    await asyncio.sleep(0)
    print("Task 1 after second yield")

async def task2():
    print("Task 2 started")
    await asyncio.sleep(0)
    print("Task 2 after first yield")
    await asyncio.sleep(0)
    print("Task 2 after second yield")

async def main():
    await asyncio.gather(task1(), task2())

asyncio.run(main())
```

Output:
```
Task 1 started
Task 2 started
Task 1 after first yield
Task 2 after first yield
Task 1 after second yield
Task 2 after second yield
```

## Key Takeaways

1. `await` always yields control to the event loop, even with sleep(0)
2. The event loop uses this opportunity to check for other ready tasks
3. This is how cooperative multitasking works in asyncio
4. Without this yielding, a single coroutine could monopolize the event loop

This behavior is actually useful - it allows other tasks to make progress even when one task is doing many quick operations (you can think of `await sleep(0)` as similar to a "yield" point in cooperative multitasking systems).

***<--------------what if I called asyncio.run(task1()) followed by asyncio.run(task2()) , will the output be same ?(new question)----------------->***
No, calling `asyncio.run()` twice with different coroutines will **not** produce the same output as running them concurrently with `asyncio.gather()`. Here's why:

### Key Differences:
1. **Separate Event Loops**: Each `asyncio.run()` creates and closes a **brand new event loop**.
2. **No Concurrency**: The coroutines run **sequentially**, not concurrently.
3. **No Task Switching**: Since each has its own event loop, there's no opportunity for cooperative multitasking between `task1` and `task2`.

### Your Example:
```python
import asyncio

async def task1():
    print("Task 1 started")
    await asyncio.sleep(0)
    print("Task 1 continued")

async def task2():
    print("Task 2 started")
    await asyncio.sleep(0)
    print("Task 2 continued")

# Sequential execution (not concurrent)
asyncio.run(task1())  # Runs to completion first
asyncio.run(task2())  # Then runs separately
```

### Output:
```
Task 1 started
Task 1 continued
Task 2 started
Task 2 continued
```

### Comparison:
| Behavior          | `asyncio.gather(task1(), task2())` | `asyncio.run(task1()); asyncio.run(task2())` |
|-------------------|------------------------------------|----------------------------------------------|
| Event Loops       | Single shared loop                 | Two separate loops                          |
| Execution         | Concurrent                         | Sequential                                  |
| Output Order      | Interleaved (tasks switch)         | Fully completes task1 before task2 starts   |
| Resource Usage    | Efficient (one loop)               | Inefficient (two loops)                     |
| Proper Usage      | ✅ Correct for async concurrency   | ❌ Wrong approach (defeats async benefits)  |

### Important Warning:
Calling `asyncio.run()` multiple times is generally **not recommended** because:
1. It creates unnecessary overhead
2. Can lead to "Event loop is closed" errors
3. Defeats the whole purpose of async concurrency
4. May cause resource leaks

The correct way to run multiple coroutines is either:
- `await asyncio.gather()`
- Creating tasks explicitly with `asyncio.create_task()`
- Using other coordination primitives from the asyncio library



***<-----------what does gather function does then ?(new question)---------------->***
`asyncio.gather()` is a **powerful coordination function** that runs multiple coroutines **concurrently** and manages their results. Here's exactly what it does:

---

### Core Functionality
1. **Concurrent Execution**:
   - Schedules all coroutines to run **simultaneously** in the same event loop
   - Allows tasks to switch during `await` points (cooperative multitasking)

2. **Result Collection**:
   - Returns a list of results in the **same order** as input coroutines
   - Waits for **all** coroutines to complete (unless errors occur)

---

### Key Features
| Feature | Description |
|---------|-------------|
| **Concurrency** | Runs coroutines in overlapping manner (not truly parallel) |
| **Order Preservation** | Results match input order, regardless of completion order |
| **Error Handling** | Optional `return_exceptions` parameter controls error behavior |
| **Cancellation** | If one task fails, can cancel others (default behavior) |

---

### Example Breakdown
```python
import asyncio

async def fetch_data(id, delay):
    print(f"Task {id} started")
    await asyncio.sleep(delay)
    print(f"Task {id} completed")
    return f"data-{id}"

async def main():
    results = await asyncio.gather(
        fetch_data(1, 2),  # Takes 2 seconds
        fetch_data(2, 1),  # Takes 1 second
        fetch_data(3, 3)   # Takes 3 seconds
    )
    print(results)  # ['data-1', 'data-2', 'data-3']

asyncio.run(main())
```

**Output Timeline**:
```
Task 1 started
Task 2 started
Task 3 started
(1 second later)
Task 2 completed
(1 more second later)
Task 1 completed
(1 more second later)
Task 3 completed
['data-1', 'data-2', 'data-3']
```

---

### Advanced Usage
1. **Error Handling**:
```python
async def main():
    try:
        await asyncio.gather(
            good_task(),
            failing_task(),  # Raises exception
            return_exceptions=False  # Default (raises immediately)
        )
    except Exception as e:
        print(f"Caught: {e}")
```

2. **Return Exceptions** (continue on error):
```python
results = await asyncio.gather(
    good_task(),
    failing_task(),
    return_exceptions=True  # Exceptions returned as results
)
# results = [success_value, Exception(...)]
```

---

### How It Differs From Sequential Execution
| Operation | Time Taken | Behavior |
|-----------|------------|----------|
| `await coro1(); await coro2()` | t1 + t2 | Sequential |
| `asyncio.gather(coro1(), coro2())` | max(t1, t2) | Concurrent |

---

### Under the Hood
1. Creates **Task** objects for each coroutine
2. Uses the event loop's **ready queue** to schedule them
3. Implements a **result aggregator** that tracks completion
4. Handles **cancellation propagation** if needed

This makes it the **Swiss Army knife** of async coordination in Python!
