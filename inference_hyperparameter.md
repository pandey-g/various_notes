explain me inferencing hyper-parameters with under the hook implementation , you can do it in turns just keep asking me if I want to know about the specific hyper-parameters ?

Great! Let's walk through **inference-time hyperparameters** in LLMs (like temperature, top-k, top-p, repetition penalty, etc.), one by one, **with both conceptual and under-the-hood implementation details**.

---

### üîß First: Quick Recap of LLM Inference

At inference time:

1. The model generates logits ‚Üí a vector of raw scores for each token in the vocabulary.
2. A sampling strategy (controlled by hyperparameters) decides **which token to pick next**.
3. That token is appended to the input and fed back into the model for the next step.

Now, each hyperparameter **modifies** this token-picking process.

---

### üß™ First Hyperparameter: `temperature`

#### üß† What it does (Conceptual)

* Controls the **randomness** of token selection.
* **Lower temperature (e.g., 0.1)** ‚Üí More deterministic ‚Üí Picks higher-probability tokens.
* **Higher temperature (e.g., 1.0‚Äì2.0)** ‚Üí More random ‚Üí Flattens the distribution ‚Üí More diverse output.

#### üî¨ Under the Hood (Implementation)

Temperature modifies the logits **before** softmax:

```python
# logits: tensor of shape [vocab_size]
adjusted_logits = logits / temperature
probs = softmax(adjusted_logits)
```

With `temperature=1.0` ‚Üí no change.
With `temperature=0.5` ‚Üí logits are scaled up ‚Üí softmax is more peaked (less randomness).
With `temperature=2.0` ‚Üí logits are scaled down ‚Üí softmax is flatter (more randomness).

---

Would you like to go deeper into `temperature` with real examples or code simulation?
Or should we move to the **next hyperparameter: `top_k` sampling**?

***<-----------------explain me about top_k --------------------->***
Perfect! Let‚Äôs dive into **`top_k` sampling**, which is another core inference-time hyperparameter.

---

### üîß Second Hyperparameter: `top_k`

---

### üß† What It Does (Conceptual)

* `top_k` controls **how many of the top probable tokens** (from the model‚Äôs output) are considered for sampling.
* The model **discards all but the top `k` tokens** with the highest logits.
* Then it **samples one token from this reduced set**, based on their (re-normalized) probabilities.

This reduces the **risk of sampling very low-probability (nonsensical) tokens**, but still allows variability.

#### Examples:

* `top_k = 1` ‚Üí **greedy decoding** (always pick the single highest-probability token).
* `top_k = 5` ‚Üí sample only from top 5 most likely tokens.
* `top_k = vocab_size` ‚Üí same as no top-k filtering.

---

### üî¨ Under the Hood (Implementation)

Here‚Äôs a minimal PyTorch-style implementation:

```python
import torch

def top_k_sampling(logits, k):
    # logits: tensor of shape [vocab_size]
    
    # Get top k logits and their indices
    top_k_logits, top_k_indices = torch.topk(logits, k)

    # Apply softmax to get probabilities
    top_k_probs = torch.softmax(top_k_logits, dim=-1)

    # Sample one token from the top_k distribution
    sampled_idx = torch.multinomial(top_k_probs, num_samples=1)

    # Convert index in top_k back to index in full vocab
    next_token = top_k_indices[sampled_idx]
    
    return next_token.item()
```

---

### üí° Why Use `top_k`?

* It removes the **long tail** of low-probability, often irrelevant tokens.
* But unlike greedy decoding, it keeps some randomness for creativity.

---

Want to explore **`top_p` (nucleus sampling)** next? It's a more dynamic alternative to `top_k`.

***<--------------yes pleasae----------------------------->***

Awesome, let‚Äôs explore **`top_p` sampling**, also known as **nucleus sampling**.

---

### üîß Third Hyperparameter: `top_p`

---

### üß† What It Does (Conceptual)

* Instead of picking a fixed number of tokens like `top_k`, `top_p` selects **the smallest set of tokens** whose **cumulative probability exceeds `p`** (e.g., 0.9).
* This is a **dynamic cutoff**: the number of tokens included can vary per step.
* It helps avoid **arbitrary hard limits** (like always picking top 5), and instead adapts based on the output distribution's shape.

---

#### Examples:

* `top_p = 1.0` ‚Üí include **all** tokens ‚Üí same as no top-p filtering.
* `top_p = 0.9` ‚Üí sample from just enough top tokens that **together account for 90%** of the probability mass.
* Often used **with `temperature`** for creative but constrained outputs.

---

### üî¨ Under the Hood (Implementation)

Here‚Äôs a step-by-step version in PyTorch:

```python
def top_p_sampling(logits, p):
    # Step 1: Get probabilities
    probs = torch.softmax(logits, dim=-1)

    # Step 2: Sort probs and indices
    sorted_probs, sorted_indices = torch.sort(probs, descending=True)

    # Step 3: Compute cumulative probability
    cumulative_probs = torch.cumsum(sorted_probs, dim=-1)

    # Step 4: Mask tokens with cumulative prob > p
    cutoff = cumulative_probs > p
    cutoff_idx = torch.argmax(cutoff).item() + 1  # first index where cumulative prob exceeds p
    top_p_probs = sorted_probs[:cutoff_idx]
    top_p_indices = sorted_indices[:cutoff_idx]

    # Step 5: Renormalize and sample
    top_p_probs = top_p_probs / top_p_probs.sum()
    sampled_idx = torch.multinomial(top_p_probs, num_samples=1)

    next_token = top_p_indices[sampled_idx]
    return next_token.item()
```

---

### üí° Why Use `top_p`?

* **More flexible than `top_k`**: sometimes fewer than 5 tokens have high probability, sometimes more than 10.
* Balances creativity and fluency, especially for **story generation, chatbots, etc.**

---

Next, do you want to cover:

* üîÅ `repetition_penalty` (to reduce repetitive loops),
* ü§ñ `max_tokens` / `max_new_tokens` (controls output length), or
* üß† A practical **comparison of `top_k` vs `top_p`** in practice?

Your pick.

***<---------------repetition_penalty----------------->***

Great choice. Let's dive into **`repetition_penalty`** ‚Äî it's super important for making LLMs sound less robotic and avoid getting stuck in loops like:

> "I am a helpful assistant. I am a helpful assistant. I am a helpful assistant..."

---

### üîß Fourth Hyperparameter: `repetition_penalty`

---

### üß† What It Does (Conceptual)

* Penalizes tokens that have **already been generated** in the current output.
* Prevents the model from **repeating the same tokens or phrases** too often.
* Especially useful in **open-ended generation**, e.g., chatbots or stories.

---

#### How It Works (High Level):

Before sampling, it adjusts the logits of previously generated tokens to **discourage** selecting them again:

* If a token was used before, its logit is **divided** by the repetition penalty (`> 1.0`) ‚Üí lowers its probability.
* If penalty = 1.0 ‚Üí no effect.

---

### üî¨ Under the Hood (Implementation)

Here‚Äôs a PyTorch-style example:

```python
def apply_repetition_penalty(logits, generated_tokens, penalty):
    logits = logits.clone()

    for token_id in set(generated_tokens):
        # Apply penalty only if token was previously used
        if logits[token_id] > 0:
            logits[token_id] /= penalty  # lower positive logits
        else:
            logits[token_id] *= penalty  # push negative logits lower

    return logits
```

This is applied **before** softmax in each generation step.

---

### ‚úÖ Example Behavior:

With `repetition_penalty = 1.2`, if the model has already generated the word **‚Äúhello‚Äù**, its logit will be reduced, making it less likely to be chosen again.

Without it, you might get output like:

> "The cat is the the the the the..."

With it, the model might say:

> "The cat is walking across the room."

---

### üîß Penalty Tuning:

| Value             | Behavior                           |
| ----------------- | ---------------------------------- |
| `1.0`             | No penalty (default for greedy)    |
| `>1.0` (e.g. 1.2) | Penalizes repetition               |
| `<1.0` (rarely)   | Encourages repetition (not common) |
