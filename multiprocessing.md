Ah, got it now ‚Äî you're asking about **Multiprocessing in Python**, not multiprogramming at the OS level. Let's explain it **clearly**, with **real use cases**, **how it works under the hood**, and a **code example**.

---

## üß† What is **Multiprocessing** in Python?

**Multiprocessing** means **running multiple processes in parallel**, where each process has **its own memory space** and **runs independently**.

In Python, this is **true parallelism**, and it‚Äôs especially useful for **CPU-bound tasks**, like:

* Heavy calculations (ML, math, image processing)
* Data parsing
* Compression/decompression
* Video/audio processing

---

## üîí Why Not Just Use Threads?

Because of the **GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)** in CPython:

* Only **one thread can execute Python bytecode at a time**.
* So even if you have multiple threads, you **don‚Äôt get parallel CPU execution** ‚Äî only concurrent I/O.

**Multiprocessing bypasses the GIL** by creating **separate processes** that each run **in their own interpreter**.

---

## üîß How Does It Work Internally?

* The `multiprocessing` module **spawns new OS processes**.
* Each process has its **own memory** (not shared like threads).
* Processes communicate via **pipes**, **queues**, or **shared memory**.
* Each process can run on a **separate CPU core** if available ‚Äî enabling real parallelism.

---

## üî® Real Example: Multiprocessing in Action

### üß™ Problem: You want to square numbers from 1 to 10 million

#### ‚úÖ With Multiprocessing

```python
from multiprocessing import Process, cpu_count
import time

def square_numbers():
    for i in range(10**7):
        i * i

if __name__ == '__main__':
    start = time.time()
    processes = []

    for _ in range(cpu_count()):  # run one process per core
        p = Process(target=square_numbers)
        p.start()
        processes.append(p)

    for p in processes:
        p.join()

    print(f"Completed in {time.time() - start:.2f} seconds")
```

‚è±Ô∏è This runs multiple `square_numbers()` in parallel on **multiple cores**.

---

## üìà Compare With Single Process Version

```python
import time

def square_numbers():
    for i in range(10**7):
        i * i

start = time.time()
square_numbers()
square_numbers()
square_numbers()
square_numbers()
print(f"Completed in {time.time() - start:.2f} seconds")
```

This runs on **one core** ‚Äî much slower for CPU-heavy tasks.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Key Concepts in `multiprocessing`

| Concept       | Explanation                                    |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------- |
| `Process()`   | Creates a new OS process                       |
| `.start()`    | Begins execution of the target function        |
| `.join()`     | Waits for a process to complete                |
| `Queue`       | Lets processes safely exchange data            |
| `Pool`        | Easy way to parallelize with a pool of workers |
| `cpu_count()` | Returns number of CPU cores available          |

---

## üì¶ Example: Parallel Web Scraping Using Pool

```python
from multiprocessing import Pool
import requests

def fetch(url):
    resp = requests.get(url)
    return url, resp.status_code

urls = ["https://httpbin.org/delay/1"] * 5  # simulate slow API

if __name__ == '__main__':
    with Pool(5) as p:
        results = p.map(fetch, urls)
    print(results)
```

‚è±Ô∏è Each request runs in parallel, one per process.

Would you like me to compare **asyncio vs threading vs multiprocessing** with real side-by-side benchmarks for a specific use case like API calls or CPU math?

***<-------------------------- why to use .join() in threading and multiprocessing ? --------------------------------------------------------------->***

Great question ‚Äî `.join()` is **very important** in both **threading** and **multiprocessing**, and understanding **why** helps you control **how and when your program finishes**.

Let‚Äôs break it down clearly.

---

## üßµ What does `.join()` do?

> **`.join()` waits for a thread or process to finish before moving on.**

So if you don‚Äôt call `.join()`, your **main program might exit** before your **threads or processes are done** ‚Äî especially if they‚Äôre still working in the background.

---

### üîç Without `.join()` (Dangerous!)

```python
from threading import Thread
import time

def task():
    time.sleep(2)
    print("Task finished!")

t = Thread(target=task)
t.start()

print("Main program ends!")
```

### üü• Output:

```
Main program ends!
Task finished!   ‚Üê may or may not appear
```

**Problem:** The main program **exits immediately**, maybe **before `task()` finishes**, so the thread might **not get to run completely**.

---

### ‚úÖ With `.join()` (Safe)

```python
from threading import Thread
import time

def task():
    time.sleep(2)
    print("Task finished!")

t = Thread(target=task)
t.start()
t.join()  # Wait until the thread is done

print("Main program ends!")
```

### ‚úÖ Output:

```
Task finished!
Main program ends!
```

Now the main program **waits** for the thread to finish before exiting.

---

## üîÑ Same with `multiprocessing`

```python
from multiprocessing import Process
import time

def worker():
    time.sleep(2)
    print("Process done")

p = Process(target=worker)
p.start()
p.join()  # Wait for process to finish

print("Main process ends")
```

Without `.join()`, the main process might exit early ‚Äî leaving zombie processes behind or cutting off output.

---

## üîß Summary: Why Use `.join()`

| Reason                  | Explanation                                              |
| ----------------------- | -------------------------------------------------------- |
| ‚úÖ Prevents early exit   | Main program waits until thread/process completes        |
| ‚úÖ Ensures correct order | Lets you finish background tasks before moving on        |
| ‚úÖ Controls flow         | You can wait for one or more to finish in specific order |
| ‚ùå Skipping `.join()`    | Can lead to unfinished work, unexpected exits            |

---

## üîÅ Bonus: When You Might **Not** Use `.join()`

You might **intentionally skip `.join()`** when:

* You're running a **background task** (like logging or monitoring) that can keep running independently.
* You're okay with the task not finishing if the main process exits.
* You're managing threads/processes in a **supervisor model** (e.g., a web server).

But for **most practical use cases**, especially beginner-level scripts: **use `.join()`** unless you know exactly why you're not.

Would you like to see `.join()` used to wait for **multiple threads or processes** in a loop?
