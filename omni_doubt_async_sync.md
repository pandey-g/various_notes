explain the abvoe code and also throw light on why did we use threading?

The `_execute_llm_call_sync` function is designed to **execute a call to a language model (LLM)** in a **synchronous context**‚Äîthat is, it waits for the LLM to respond before continuing execution. Here's a detailed breakdown:

---

### ‚úÖ **Code Explanation**

```python
def _execute_llm_call_sync(self, step: WorkflowStep, messages: List[Dict[str, str]], state: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
```

* **Purpose**: Executes an LLM call for a given workflow step and returns the response (or raises an error).
* **Parameters**:

  * `step`: An instance of `WorkflowStep` that includes LLM config and step ID.
  * `messages`: A list of message dictionaries (`{"role": ..., "content": ...}`) to feed into the LLM.
  * `state`: A dictionary representing current workflow state (e.g., `workflow_name`, `workflow_id`).

---

### üí° **Inside the Function**

#### 1. **Queue Setup**

```python
result_queue = queue.Queue()
```

* Used to safely share the result or error from the background thread back to the main thread.

#### 2. **Thread Target Function**

```python
def run_llm_call():
    ...
```

* Calls `self.llm_client.call_llm(...)` with proper parameters, handles exceptions, and pushes result or error into the queue.

#### 3. **Starting the Thread**

```python
thread = threading.Thread(target=run_llm_call)
thread.start()
thread.join()
```

* `thread.start()`: Begins execution of `run_llm_call()` in a new thread.
* `thread.join()`: Blocks the main thread **until** the background thread finishes.

#### 4. **Getting the Result**

```python
status, result = result_queue.get()
```

* Retrieves the outcome from the queue.
* If `status == "error"`, it raises the exception.
* Otherwise, it returns the generated content from the LLM response.

---

### üîç Why Use **Threading** in a Synchronous Function?

Using a thread inside a synchronous function **may seem counterintuitive**, but it serves a few practical purposes:

| ‚úÖ Reason                                          | Explanation                                                                                                                                      |
| ------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Avoiding Blocking I/O Inside Client Libraries** | Some LLM clients may use internal blocking I/O (like HTTP requests), and running it in a thread can isolate it without freezing the main loop.   |
| **Timeout Handling (extendable)**                 | While not shown here, threading allows you to implement custom timeouts or cancelation mechanisms (`thread.join(timeout)`).                      |
| **Cross-compatibility with async environments**   | In some frameworks (like FastAPI), a sync function might be called in an async context. Threads help prevent blocking the event loop indirectly. |
| **Failsafe for Errors**                           | By isolating the LLM call in a thread, exceptions are neatly caught and handled via the queue rather than crashing the entire workflow.          |

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

* The function wraps the LLM call in a **background thread** to isolate the execution, catch exceptions, and ensure the main thread remains clean and safe.
* This pattern is especially useful when:

  * You want to run potentially blocking code in a controlled manner.
  * You need more control over error propagation and timeout.
  * You‚Äôre maintaining compatibility between sync and async codebases.

Would you like me to help you modify this to support **timeout or cancellation**, or convert it to **fully async** if your stack supports it?


***<---------------------what is background thread and main thread in python ?------------------->***
In Python, **threads** allow you to run multiple operations concurrently within a single process. When we talk about the **main thread** and **background (or child) threads**, we are referring to how Python executes code in a multi-threaded context.

---

### üßµ What is the **Main Thread**?

* The **main thread** is the thread that starts automatically when you run a Python program.
* It‚Äôs where your program begins execution (`if __name__ == "__main__":`).
* All your top-level code runs in this thread by default.

```python
import threading

print(threading.current_thread().name)
# Output: MainThread
```

---

### üßµ What is a **Background (or Child) Thread**?

* A **background thread** (also called a **worker thread** or **child thread**) is a thread you explicitly create to run tasks in parallel to the main thread.
* It runs *alongside* the main thread but executes a different function.
* Useful for tasks like I/O, API calls, background processing, etc.

```python
import threading

def background_task():
    print("Running in background:", threading.current_thread().name)

thread = threading.Thread(target=background_task)
thread.start()
thread.join()
```

---

### üß† Analogy

Think of your program as a restaurant kitchen:

* The **main thread** is the head chef preparing the main dish (core logic).
* You might hire a **background cook (thread)** to handle the soup or dessert at the same time ‚Äî they work independently, and once they‚Äôre done, they bring back the result.

---

### üîÑ Why Use Background Threads?

| Use Case         | Example                                                          |
| ---------------- | ---------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Non-blocking I/O | Fetching data from an API without freezing the UI                |
| Parallelism      | Performing two or more unrelated tasks at once                   |
| Isolation        | Run risky or long-running tasks without affecting the main logic |

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è Note: Python's GIL

Python (CPython) has a **Global Interpreter Lock (GIL)**, which means:

* Only **one thread runs Python bytecode at a time**.
* However, threads **are still useful for I/O-bound tasks** (network, disk, etc.).
* For CPU-bound parallelism, use `multiprocessing` instead.

---

### ‚úÖ Summary

| Term                  | Meaning                                                               |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| **Main Thread**       | The original thread where the program starts                          |
| **Background Thread** | Any additional thread created to run tasks concurrently               |
| **Why use threads?**  | To prevent blocking, run tasks in parallel, or improve responsiveness |

Would you like to see how threading compares to `asyncio` or `multiprocessing`?


***<-----------------Give me an analogy example, which might explain the concept more intuitively.---------------------------->***
Sure! Here's a **real-world analogy** that explains **main thread vs. background threads** using a **kitchen in a restaurant**:

---

### üçΩÔ∏è **Analogy: Restaurant Kitchen**

Imagine you‚Äôre a **chef** in a busy restaurant. You‚Äôre preparing a **multi-course meal** for a customer.

#### üë®‚Äçüç≥ You (Main Thread)

You‚Äôre the **head chef**‚Äîyou‚Äôre responsible for assembling the full dish (main logic of your program). You start with:

* Cooking the main course
* Calling the waiter
* Serving food

You're doing this all **sequentially**.

---

### Problem: Slow Task in Your Flow

Let‚Äôs say:

* The **dessert** needs to bake in the oven for 40 minutes.
* If you (the head chef) put the dessert in the oven and **wait there** doing nothing for 40 minutes, no other dishes will be prepared. **The kitchen is stuck.**

---

### üßµ Solution: Hire an Assistant (Background Thread)

Instead of waiting, you hire an **assistant cook** (background thread).

* You give them instructions: ‚ÄúBake this dessert and tell me when it‚Äôs done.‚Äù
* You go back to making the **main course**, **serving drinks**, or handling other tasks (main thread keeps running).

Once the assistant finishes baking, they **return with the dessert**, and you **collect it from them** when needed.

---

### üß† Mapping the Analogy to Code

| Real World (Kitchen)            | Python Threads                                  |
| ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Head chef                       | Main thread                                     |
| Assistant cook                  | Background thread                               |
| Baking dessert                  | Long-running task (e.g., LLM call, API request) |
| Waiting for assistant to return | `thread.join()`                                 |
| Kitchen stuck while waiting     | Blocking the main thread                        |

---

### ‚úÖ Result

* The **main thread** keeps working efficiently.
* **Background threads** handle long-running or I/O-heavy tasks without freezing the whole system.

---

### Bonus üç∞

If you want multiple assistants each doing separate things (e.g., boiling, baking, plating), that‚Äôs **multi-threading**. But if you had many head chefs each in their own kitchens using separate ovens, that‚Äôs **multiprocessing** (used for CPU-heavy work).

---

Let me know if you'd like this analogy turned into a diagram!

***<-------------------Okay, write the code for the same.--------------------->***

Sure! Here‚Äôs the **Python code that mirrors the restaurant analogy** with a **main thread (head chef)** and a **background thread (assistant cook)** baking a dessert:

---

### üßë‚Äçüç≥ Python Code: Main vs Background Thread (Kitchen Analogy)

```python
import threading
import time

def bake_dessert():
    print("üßÅ Assistant cook: Starting to bake the dessert (this will take 5 seconds)...")
    time.sleep(5)  # Simulating time-consuming task
    print("üßÅ Assistant cook: Dessert is ready!")

def main_kitchen_work():
    print("üë®‚Äçüç≥ Head chef: Preparing the main course...")
    time.sleep(2)
    print("üë®‚Äçüç≥ Head chef: Main course is halfway done.")

    # Start background thread for baking dessert
    dessert_thread = threading.Thread(target=bake_dessert)
    dessert_thread.start()

    print("üë®‚Äçüç≥ Head chef: Meanwhile, I'm plating the salad and setting the table.")
    time.sleep(3)
    print("üë®‚Äçüç≥ Head chef: Ready to serve the main course.")

    # Wait for dessert to be ready before serving everything
    dessert_thread.join()
    print("üë®‚Äçüç≥ Head chef: All dishes are ready to serve!")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main_kitchen_work()
```

---

### üß† Output Explanation

When you run this code, you‚Äôll see:

1. The **head chef** starts preparing the main course.
2. The **assistant cook** (background thread) starts baking the dessert (a long task).
3. While the assistant is working, the head chef continues with other things (e.g., plating).
4. The head chef **waits for the assistant to finish** using `join()` before serving everything.

---

### üîÅ Sample Output (Formatted)

```
üë®‚Äçüç≥ Head chef: Preparing the main course...
üë®‚Äçüç≥ Head chef: Main course is halfway done.
üßÅ Assistant cook: Starting to bake the dessert (this will take 5 seconds)...
üë®‚Äçüç≥ Head chef: Meanwhile, I'm plating the salad and setting the table.
üë®‚Äçüç≥ Head chef: Ready to serve the main course.
üßÅ Assistant cook: Dessert is ready!
üë®‚Äçüç≥ Head chef: All dishes are ready to serve!
```

Let me know if you want a version that handles **multiple assistants** or converts this to use **async/await** instead of threads!


***<-----------------def _execute_llm_call(self, step: WorkflowStep, messages: List[Dict[str, str]], state: Dict[str, Any]) -> str:
        """Execute the LLM call for the step."""
        loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
        
        if loop.is_running():

        else:
            # Handle sync context
            return self._execute_llm_call_async(step, messages, state)


explain this when seeing if loop.is_running() why he is calling sync part ?----------------------------->***



Great question! Let's break it down clearly:

---

### ‚úÖ **Code in Focus**

```python
loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()

if loop.is_running():
    # Handle async context with threading
    return self._execute_llm_call_sync(step, messages, state)
else:
    # Handle sync context
    return self._execute_llm_call_async(step, messages, state)
```

---

### üß† What does `loop.is_running()` mean?

* `asyncio.get_event_loop()` gets the current event loop.
* `loop.is_running()` returns `True` **if you're already inside an async context**, i.e., you're already running inside an `async def` function or FastAPI/LangGraph node, etc.

---

### ü§Ø The Confusing Bit:

> If the loop **is running**, why do we call the **sync** version?

This seems backwards, right? But here's **why it makes sense**:

---

### ‚ö†Ô∏è You Can't `await` in a Running Event Loop from a Sync Function

When you are already **inside an async event loop**, and you try to call `await something()` **from a non-async function** (like this one), Python will throw an error like:

```
RuntimeError: Cannot run the event loop while another loop is running
```

So if you tried to do this:

```python
loop.run_until_complete(self._execute_llm_call_async(...))  # ‚ùå Fails inside running loop
```

it would **crash** if you're already inside `async def`.

---

### ‚úÖ Solution: Use a Thread Instead

So the author of this code made a **smart workaround**:

| If already inside async loop (`loop.is_running()`)                                                                | Then don't use `await` or `run_until_complete`. |
| ----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Instead, run the LLM call in a **background thread** using `threading.Thread`, like in `_execute_llm_call_sync()` | ‚úÖ                                               |

The "sync" function here is not *truly synchronous* in a blocking sense‚Äîit uses a **background thread** to keep the async event loop responsive.

---

### üß† Summary

| Condition                                    | Reason                                                                                                                   |
| -------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| `loop.is_running()` is `True`                | We're already inside an `async` context (e.g., FastAPI endpoint, LangGraph step).                                        |
| We can‚Äôt block or use `run_until_complete()` | So we use `self._execute_llm_call_sync()` which internally uses **threading** to isolate the LLM call.                   |
| `loop.is_running()` is `False`               | We're outside an async context, so it's safe to call `await` using `run_until_complete()` in `_execute_llm_call_async()` |

---

### üìå In Short

> **The code calls the ‚Äúsync‚Äù version (which uses a thread)** when the event loop is already running **to avoid blocking or crashing the async environment**.

Let me know if you want this behavior visualized with a small runnable example or need a full async-compatible version of the call!


***<------------I didn't exactly get what you are sayign can you give an analogy for better understanding ?------------->***

Absolutely! Let‚Äôs go with a clear **analogy** to explain this `loop.is_running()` logic ‚Äî using a **restaurant and oven analogy**, just like before.

---

### üçΩÔ∏è **Analogy: One Kitchen Oven (Async Event Loop)**

Imagine you‚Äôre running a **restaurant kitchen**, and you only have **one oven** (just like Python has one async event loop).

---

### Scene 1: üîÑ **You‚Äôre already using the oven (loop is running)**

You (the head chef) are already baking **bread** inside the oven.

Now someone asks you to bake a **dessert** (LLM call = long operation).

But:

* The oven is **already busy**.
* If you try to use it **directly again**, you'll break the flow of cooking. The oven might **overheat or crash** (RuntimeError).

So what do you do?

> ‚úÖ **You ask your assistant (a new thread)** to take the dessert and **bake it in their own mini-oven** (i.e., run the LLM call in a thread).
> You (main async loop) keep working, and the dessert gets baked separately.

‚û°Ô∏è This is why the code calls `_execute_llm_call_sync()` with **threading**, even though it‚Äôs in an ‚Äúasync‚Äù environment ‚Äî it avoids blocking the busy oven (event loop).

---

### Scene 2: üõë **Oven is not running yet (loop is not running)**

You‚Äôre just entering the kitchen. No oven is currently baking anything.

You are free to:

* Use the oven directly.
* Bake the dessert yourself, without needing an assistant.

So:

> ‚úÖ You **call the async function directly** using `.run_until_complete(...)` in `_execute_llm_call_async()`.

---

### üß† Mapping to Python

| Analogy               | Python Code Concept                           |
| --------------------- | --------------------------------------------- |
| Oven already in use   | `loop.is_running() == True`                   |
| Ask assistant to bake | Use `threading` (in `_execute_llm_call_sync`) |
| Oven is free          | `loop.is_running() == False`                  |
| Bake directly         | Use `await` or `run_until_complete()`         |

---

### ‚úÖ Summary in Plain Words

* If the async loop is **already running**, you can‚Äôt just `await` or run more coroutines inside it from a normal function ‚Äî Python will throw an error.
* Instead, you **offload** the LLM task to a **background thread** so the main async system keeps working.
* If no async loop is running, it‚Äôs safe to run async code normally using `.run_until_complete()`.

---

Let me know if you want a visual diagram or runnable version of this analogy in Python!

***<----------------Why check for an event loop in the first place? We can just directly execute the sync version, right?----->***


Excellent question ‚Äî and you're right to challenge this!

At first glance, it might seem simpler to always use the synchronous (`_execute_llm_call_sync`) version that internally uses a thread. But checking whether an event loop is already running **serves a deeper purpose**, especially in environments where **asynchronous execution is more efficient**.

---

### üîç So, why not always use the sync (threaded) version?

Let‚Äôs go through both sides:

---

## ‚úÖ **Why Check for an Event Loop? (Good Reason to Prefer Async)**

When you're **not already in an async environment**, using `await` or running async functions via `run_until_complete()` is perfectly fine ‚Äî and **more efficient** than spinning up a thread.

Using the `async` version directly avoids:

* Overhead of thread creation
* Complexity of thread-safe queues and joins
* Unnecessary context switches

### üîÑ Analogy

If the oven (event loop) is **free**, why ask an assistant (thread) to do it?
You can just bake it yourself ‚Äî faster and simpler.

---

## üö´ **Why not always use the sync version (with a thread)?**

Using the sync version always seems easier, **but** it comes with trade-offs:

| Problem                               | Why it matters                                                                                                           |
| ------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Thread overhead**                   | Spawning a thread is slower and more memory-intensive than using `await`                                                 |
| **Harder to debug**                   | Threads make stack traces more complex                                                                                   |
| **No fine-grained async control**     | You lose the ability to `await`, `cancel`, or chain calls efficiently                                                    |
| **Not composable in async workflows** | In systems like LangGraph, FastAPI, or asyncio pipelines, you want to stay inside the async world for better integration |

---

### ‚úÖ So the code is optimized like this:

| If...                             | Then...                                                 | Why                                                    |
| --------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------ |
| We're inside an async environment | Use a thread (`_execute_llm_call_sync`)                 | Because we can't `await` directly from a sync function |
| We're outside async               | Run async function directly (`_execute_llm_call_async`) | More efficient, no need for threads                    |

---

### üß† In Short

> The reason we check for `loop.is_running()` is **to do the right thing based on the runtime context**.

* ‚úÖ If we‚Äôre already inside an event loop ‚Üí we **can‚Äôt** use `await` from a sync function ‚Üí so we spawn a thread instead.
* ‚úÖ If no loop is running ‚Üí we **can** run async code properly ‚Üí so we use the cleaner, more efficient path.

Would you like me to show a **code comparison** of what happens if we naively use `await` in a running loop vs not?


***<-----------------what does loop.run_until_complete() mean ? where inside this function we call an async function.---------------------->***

Great follow-up! Let's explain what `loop.run_until_complete()` does, **why and when it's used**, and **how it lets you run async code inside a synchronous function**.

---

## ‚úÖ What is `loop.run_until_complete()`?

`loop.run_until_complete(coro)` is a method that:

* **Takes an `awaitable` (usually an async function)**.
* Starts the **event loop** if it‚Äôs not running already.
* Runs the **async function** until it finishes.
* Returns the result of the coroutine.
* Blocks the **current (sync) thread** while the event loop runs.

---

### üß† In plain English:

> "`loop.run_until_complete()` is how you run an `async def` function from normal synchronous code."

---

## üß™ Example: Where it's used

```python
import asyncio

async def say_hello():
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    return "Hello from async!"

def main():
    loop = asyncio.get_event_loop()
    result = loop.run_until_complete(say_hello())
    print(result)

main()
```

### Output:

```
Hello from async!
```

---

## üîç What happens inside `loop.run_until_complete()`?

Behind the scenes, it does something like:

1. **Start the event loop**.
2. **Schedule the coroutine** (your async function) on the loop.
3. **Run the loop** until that task is completed.
4. **Return** the result.
5. **Stop the loop** after it's done.

---

## üß± Internals (Simplified)

Here's a **conceptual breakdown** (not actual source code):

```python
def run_until_complete(self, coro):
    task = ensure_future(coro)       # Step 1: Wrap coroutine in a Task
    self._run_once_loop()            # Step 2: Run loop repeatedly
    while not task.done():
        self._run_once_loop()        # Step 3: Keep looping until task finishes
    return task.result()             # Step 4: Return result
```

---

## ‚ö†Ô∏è When Not to Use It

You **cannot** call `loop.run_until_complete()` if the event loop is **already running**.
Doing so will raise:

```
RuntimeError: This event loop is already running
```

That‚Äôs why we check for `loop.is_running()` first!

Would you like a visual explanation or a real-world example where you see this used in something like FastAPI, LangGraph, or Jupyter (where `run_until_complete` usually fails)?

***<-------------------------Address the below queries of mine:
1) Does starting async loop stops the main thread and is main thread sync ?
2) Does starting async loop stops all the sync function ()-------------------------------->***


Great questions! Let's break them down clearly and one by one:

---

## ‚úÖ 1. **Does starting an async loop stop the main thread? Is the main thread synchronous?**

### ‚úÖ Answer:

**No, starting an async loop does not stop the main thread ‚Äî because the async loop itself runs in the main thread.**
But yes, **the main thread is synchronous by default** unless you run async code inside it.

---

### üîç Explanation:

* In Python, by default your code starts in the **main thread**, which is **synchronous**.
* When you use `asyncio.run()` or `loop.run_until_complete(...)`, you're starting an **event loop inside the main thread**.
* The main thread is **not paused or blocked** ‚Äî it‚Äôs just **busy running the event loop**.

> So: the main thread becomes dedicated to running async tasks (like a dispatcher or conductor). It doesn't pause itself; it switches between coroutines.

---

### üîß Analogy:

Imagine you're the **head chef** (main thread), and instead of cooking one dish at a time, you're now watching multiple timers for several dishes (coroutines). You're still active ‚Äî just multitasking through the async loop.

---

## ‚úÖ 2. **Does starting the async loop stop all sync functions from running?**

### ‚úÖ Answer:

**No, it doesn't stop synchronous functions, but it may delay them if they're part of the same flow and not properly isolated.**

---

### üß† Detailed Explanation:

There are **two cases** to consider:

### Case A: Sync function called **outside** the event loop

```python
def sync_function():
    print("I am sync")

async def main():
    print("Starting async")
    sync_function()
    await asyncio.sleep(1)

asyncio.run(main())
```

‚úÖ `sync_function()` runs just fine **inside the async flow** ‚Äî it blocks the loop momentarily, but it runs.

---

### Case B: Long sync function blocks the event loop

```python
import asyncio
import time

def blocking_sync():
    print("Started blocking sync")
    time.sleep(5)
    print("Ended blocking sync")

async def main():
    print("Start async task")
    blocking_sync()  # üö´ BAD: blocks the whole event loop
    print("End async task")

asyncio.run(main())
```

‚ö†Ô∏è In this case, `blocking_sync()` **will block the async loop** and prevent `await`ed tasks from running during that time. The loop can‚Äôt switch to other coroutines while it's waiting for `time.sleep(5)`.

> Async loops can't "interrupt" a sync function ‚Äî they **cooperate**, not preempt.

| ------------------------------------------ | -------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| Is the main thread synchronous?            | ‚úÖ Yes, by default. It runs async loop when you explicitly start one. |
| Does starting async loop stop main thread? | ‚ùå No. The main thread runs the loop. It's active.                    |
| Does async loop stop all sync functions?   | ‚ùå No, but sync functions block async if not offloaded to a thread.   |

---

## ‚úÖ Pro Tip

If you want to run a blocking sync function **without interrupting the async loop**, use:

```python
await asyncio.to_thread(sync_function)
```

This runs the sync function in a **separate thread**, keeping the async loop responsive.

---

Would you like to see how `asyncio.to_thread()` solves this problem in practice?


***<------------------------In above code we saw that while we have event_loop we call sync function creating a thread !! but why creat thread we can just run that function right ?-------------------------------->***

You're absolutely right to question this ‚Äî it's an important point, and the reasoning isn't obvious at first.

Let‚Äôs take your question and answer it in both **technical** and **intuitive** terms.

---

## ‚ùì Question Recap:

> In the `_execute_llm_call` function, when an event loop is already running (`loop.is_running()`), we run a *"sync"* version of the LLM call **using a thread**.
> But if we already have the function ‚Äî **why not just run it directly** (like a normal sync function)?
> **Why bother with creating a thread?**

---

## ‚úÖ Short Answer:

> **Because the function internally makes an async LLM call**, and **we can't run `await` or `async` code directly inside a sync function if the event loop is already running** ‚Äî it would throw a `RuntimeError`.

So, we use a **thread** to offload that async task **into a separate execution context** ‚Äî where we can safely run `await` using `run_until_complete()`.

---

## üîç Let's Deep Dive: What‚Äôs Really Happening

### Let's say we try to do this inside a sync function while the event loop is already running:

```python
def _execute_llm_call(self):
    result = asyncio.get_event_loop().run_until_complete(self.some_async_function())
    return result
```

‚ö†Ô∏è If this code runs **while the event loop is already running** (e.g., inside FastAPI or LangGraph), it will crash with:

```
RuntimeError: This event loop is already running
```

---

## ‚úÖ Why a Thread Solves This

By running the async function **inside a thread**, you're creating an **isolated environment**:

* That thread has **its own stack**.
* You can start a **fresh event loop** in that thread.
* You can safely call `run_until_complete()` without clashing with the already-running loop in the main thread.

### ‚úîÔ∏è Thread allows:

```python
thread = threading.Thread(target=run_llm_call)
thread.start()
```

Where `run_llm_call()` internally does:

```python
loop = asyncio.new_event_loop()
asyncio.set_event_loop(loop)
response = loop.run_until_complete(self.call_llm(...))
```

üß† This **isolates** the async execution from the already-running event loop in the main thread.

---

## üçΩÔ∏è Analogy Time (Oven again!)

Imagine the main kitchen oven (event loop) is busy making lasagna (already running). You want to bake a cake (LLM call), which also needs the oven.

You **can‚Äôt just shove the cake into the oven** while the lasagna is baking. So instead:

> You tell an **assistant** (thread) to go to a **different kitchen** and bake the cake there.
> That kitchen has **its own oven** (event loop). ‚úÖ

## ‚úÖ Summary Table

| Option                              | Works when event loop is running? | Why?                          |
| ----------------------------------- | --------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| Run async directly in sync function | ‚ùå No                              | Crashes with RuntimeError     |
| Use `await` from sync               | ‚ùå No                              | Only valid in `async def`     |
| Use a thread + event loop inside    | ‚úÖ Yes                             | Thread has its own event loop |

---

## ‚úÖ TL;DR

> You **can't call async code from sync code if the event loop is already running**, so you use a thread to **escape the current loop context** and run a new one.

Let me know if you'd like a small runnable example that demonstrates this RuntimeError and how threading solves it!
