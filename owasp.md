The **OWASP (Open Worldwide Application Security Project)** provides industry-standard **guidelines, best practices, and tools** to improve software security. These are widely used by developers, DevOps, security engineers, and organizations to reduce vulnerabilities in web and software applications.

## üîê OWASP Key Guidelines and Resources

### 1. **OWASP Top 10**

A globally recognized list of the **top 10 most critical web application security risks**. Updated regularly.

Latest (2021 edition):

| Rank | Risk                                           | Description                                          |
| ---- | ---------------------------------------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- |
| A01  | **Broken Access Control**                      | Users can access resources or actions they shouldn‚Äôt |
| A02  | **Cryptographic Failures**                     | Weak or missing encryption of sensitive data         |
| A03  | **Injection**                                  | SQL, NoSQL, OS command, or LDAP injection flaws      |
| A04  | **Insecure Design**                            | Poor security architecture/design decisions          |
| A05  | **Security Misconfiguration**                  | Improper settings (e.g., open cloud storage)         |
| A06  | **Vulnerable and Outdated Components**         | Using libraries with known vulnerabilities           |
| A07  | **Identification and Authentication Failures** | Weak auth, session hijacking                         |
| A08  | **Software and Data Integrity Failures**       | Unsafe CI/CD, untrusted code                         |
| A09  | **Security Logging and Monitoring Failures**   | Poor visibility into malicious activities            |
| A10  | **Server-Side Request Forgery (SSRF)**         | Server makes unwanted requests to internal systems   |

### 2. **OWASP ASVS (Application Security Verification Standard)**

A **detailed checklist** of security controls for application development and testing. It‚Äôs categorized into 3 levels:

* **Level 1:** Basic, general apps
* **Level 2:** Apps with sensitive data
* **Level 3:** High-assurance applications (e.g., financial, health)

üìò Docs: [https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/](https://owasp.org/www-project-application-security-verification-standard/)

### 3. **OWASP Cheat Sheet Series**

A collection of **best-practice cheat sheets** for specific topics (e.g. JWT, CORS, authentication, input validation).

Examples:

* [Authentication Cheat Sheet](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/Authentication_Cheat_Sheet.html)
* [Secure Headers](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/HTTP_Headers_Cheat_Sheet.html)
* [SQL Injection Prevention](https://cheatsheetseries.owasp.org/cheatsheets/SQL_Injection_Prevention_Cheat_Sheet.html)

---

### 4. **OWASP Mobile Top 10**

Focuses on **mobile app security** risks, e.g. insecure storage, poor authentication, insecure communication.

### 5. **OWASP Dependency-Check & CycloneDX**

* Tools to **scan your project for vulnerable libraries** (like `npm audit`, `pip-audit`, etc.).
* CycloneDX is a Software Bill of Materials (SBOM) format.

## ‚úÖ Summary of OWASP Best Practices

* ‚úÖ Validate and sanitize all input
* ‚úÖ Use strong authentication and session management
* ‚úÖ Store sensitive data securely (use hashing + encryption)
* ‚úÖ Keep software dependencies up to date
* ‚úÖ Enable secure headers (CSP, HSTS, X-Content-Type)
* ‚úÖ Log security-relevant events
* ‚úÖ Follow the Principle of Least Privilege
* ‚úÖ Apply secure coding practices throughout SDLC
* ‚úÖ Scan for known vulnerabilities regularly
* ‚úÖ Educate developers on security basics (e.g., via OWASP resources)
