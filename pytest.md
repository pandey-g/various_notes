`pytest` is a **popular testing framework for Python** used to write simple as well as scalable and complex test cases for Python code. It helps developers ensure their code is correct and continues to work as expected over time.

### Key Features of `pytest`:

* **Simple syntax**: Writing tests is easy‚Äîjust use functions prefixed with `test_`.
* **Auto-discovery**: It automatically finds test files and test functions.
* **Detailed failure reports**: Offers informative output when tests fail.
* **Fixtures**: Powerful and flexible system for setting up test dependencies.
* **Plugins**: Supports a wide ecosystem of plugins (e.g. `pytest-django`, `pytest-cov`, etc.).
* **Parameterization**: Run the same test function with different data.

### Example:

```python
# test_sample.py

def add(x, y):
    return x + y

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
```

To run this test:

```bash
pytest test_sample.py
```

### Why use `pytest`?

* Less boilerplate than `unittest`.
* Supports both unit and functional tests.
* Easily integrates with continuous integration systems like GitHub Actions, Jenkins, etc.

***<------------------------new question----------------------->***

To do **unit testing** in Python, you generally use a testing framework like `pytest` or the built-in `unittest` module. Here's a step-by-step guide using **`pytest`**, since it's simpler and more powerful for most use cases.

---

## ‚úÖ Step-by-Step: Unit Testing with `pytest`

### 1. **Install `pytest`** (if not already installed)

```bash
pip install pytest
```

---

### 2. **Write Your Python Code**

Suppose you have a file called `calculator.py`:

```python
# calculator.py

def add(a, b):
    return a + b

def subtract(a, b):
    return a - b
```

---

### 3. **Write Unit Tests**

Create a new file named `test_calculator.py` in the same directory:

```python
# test_calculator.py

from calculator import add, subtract

def test_add():
    assert add(2, 3) == 5
    assert add(-1, 1) == 0

def test_subtract():
    assert subtract(5, 3) == 2
    assert subtract(10, 10) == 0
```

---

### 4. **Run the Tests**

In your terminal, run:

```bash
pytest
```

`pytest` will automatically discover any files named `test_*.py` or `*_test.py`, and functions named `test_*`.

---

### 5. **Read the Output**

If all tests pass, you'll see:

```
============================= test session starts =============================
collected 2 items

test_calculator.py ..                                                [100%]

============================== 2 passed in 0.01s ==============================
```

If a test fails, `pytest` gives detailed error messages showing what went wrong.

---

## üîÅ Tips for Real Projects

* Put your tests in a `tests/` folder.
* Use **fixtures** for setup/teardown (e.g., database setup).
* Use **assertions** to compare expected vs actual results.
* Add **coverage** reports with `pytest-cov`.

---

## üöÄ Bonus: Run with Coverage

```bash
pip install pytest-cov
pytest --cov=calculator test_calculator.py
```
