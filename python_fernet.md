***<---------------------what is encode and decode in fernet?---------------------------------------------------->***

In the context of Fernet encryption using the Python cryptography library, encode() and decode() are methods used for converting data between string and byte representations. These are fundamental operations when handling text data for encryption and decryption. 

• encode(): This method is called on a string to convert it into a sequence of bytes. Encryption algorithms like Fernet operate on bytes, not directly on strings. Therefore, before encrypting a message, it must be converted from its string representation into a byte representation using an encoding scheme (e.g., UTF-8, ASCII). 

    message_string = "Hello, Fernet!"
    message_bytes = message_string.encode('utf-8') # Converts string to bytes

• decode(): This method is called on a sequence of bytes to convert it back into a string. After decryption, Fernet returns the plaintext as bytes. To use or display this plaintext as a readable string, it needs to be decoded using the same encoding scheme that was used during the encoding process. 

    decrypted_bytes = b'Hello, Fernet!' # Example of decrypted bytes
    decrypted_string = decrypted_bytes.decode('utf-8') # Converts bytes to string

In summary, encode() prepares a string for encryption by converting it to bytes, and decode() converts the decrypted bytes back into a readable string. This conversion is crucial for handling textual data within the byte-oriented operations of cryptographic functions.

***<------------------------------what is base64.b64encode(encrypted_bytes).decode() ?------------------------------------------------->***

The expression base64.b64encode(encrypted_bytes).decode() represents a two-step process in Python, typically used for handling binary data, especially after encryption. 

• base64.b64encode(encrypted_bytes): 
	• This part utilizes the base64 module in Python, specifically the b64encode() function. 
	• It takes encrypted_bytes as input, which is expected to be a bytes object (binary data resulting from an encryption process). 
	• The function performs Base64 encoding on these encrypted_bytes. Base64 is an encoding scheme that converts binary data into an ASCII string format, making it safe for transmission over mediums that may not handle raw binary data well (e.g., email, URLs, or embedding in text-based formats like JSON). 
	• The output of b64encode() is still a bytes object, but now it contains the Base64-encoded representation of the original encrypted_bytes. 

• .decode(): 
	• This part is a method called on the bytes object returned by b64encode(). 
	• It converts the Base64-encoded bytes object into a standard Python string (str). 
	• By default, decode() typically uses UTF-8 encoding, but you can specify a different encoding if needed (e.g., .decode('ascii') as Base64 encoded data primarily uses ASCII characters). 

In summary, base64.b64encode(encrypted_bytes).decode() takes binary data (like encrypted data), converts it into a Base64-encoded sequence of bytes, and then decodes those bytes into a human-readable string representation. This string can then be easily stored, transmitted, or embedded within text-based formats.
