Exactly! ✅ You've got the right idea — and let me refine and confirm it for clarity:

## ✅ Best Practice for Imports in Python

> **Always import using the full absolute path from the nearest shared root package.**

---

## 🔍 What is the “shared node”?

In your project:

```
src/
├── app/
│   ├── models/
│   │   └── chat_models.py
│   └── services/
│       └── test.py
```

The common package (or node) between `test.py` and `chat_models.py` is `app`. So the correct import is:

```python
from app.models.chat_models import Myc
```

---

## 💡 Why start from the common root (e.g., `app`)?

Because:

* ✅ It's **unambiguous**: every module/package starts at the same root.
* ✅ It's **stable**: even if the directory structure changes, the import path remains the same as long as the root layout is stable.
* ✅ It's **production-friendly**: works consistently with linters, test runners, and deployment tools.

## 🔄 Other Examples

### Example 1:

From `app/services/test.py` to `omni/core/llm/lang.py`:

> Common node = `src`, so you write:

```python
from omni.core.llm.lang import SomeClass
```

### Example 2:

From `omni/core/llm/lang.py` to `app/models/chat_models.py`:

> Still under `src`, so:

```python
from app.models.chat_models import ChatModel
```

> ✅ Consistent root = `src`
> ✅ All imports begin from first-level folders inside `src` like `app`, `omni`, `documents`

---

## ✅ Final Rule of Thumb

> 🎯 **Start your import from the top-level package below your `PYTHONPATH`.**
> That top-level package is usually the folder like `src`, and all imports are rooted from there.

So in your case:

* Set `PYTHONPATH=src`
* Start imports from `app`, `omni`, etc.
* Never use relative imports or `..` if you can avoid it.

Would you like me to generate a visual map of your import paths, or a script to verify import correctness across your project?
