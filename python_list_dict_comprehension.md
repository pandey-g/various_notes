***How to get intuition for list comprehension, and what are the best practices ?***

Getting comfortable with **list comprehensions** in Python is all about building an **intuitive understanding** of how they *replace loops* in a concise and readable way. Here's a breakdown that builds intuition step-by-step, followed by best practices:

---

### üö¶ Intuition: Understanding List Comprehension

#### ‚úÖ 1. **Basic Structure**

```python
[expression for item in iterable]
```

It reads like:

> "Give me a list of `expression`, for each `item` in `iterable`."

Example:

```python
[x * 2 for x in [1, 2, 3]]
# Output: [2, 4, 6]
```

**Compare with loop**:

```python
result = []
for x in [1, 2, 3]:
    result.append(x * 2)
```

‚û°Ô∏è **Intuition tip**: Think of it like a one-liner that *maps* each value in the iterable to a new one.

---

#### ‚úÖ 2. **With Condition (`if`)**

```python
[expression for item in iterable if condition]
```

Example:

```python
[x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0]
# Output: [0, 2, 4, 6, 8]
```

**Compare with loop**:

```python
result = []
for x in range(10):
    if x % 2 == 0:
        result.append(x)
```

‚û°Ô∏è Think of it as filtering **while** mapping.

---

#### ‚úÖ 3. **With Condition (`if-else`)**

To include a value for *all* items, use `if-else` in the expression:

```python
['even' if x % 2 == 0 else 'odd' for x in range(5)]
# Output: ['even', 'odd', 'even', 'odd', 'even']
```

‚û°Ô∏è Think of it as "conditional mapping" rather than filtering.

---

#### ‚úÖ 4. **Nested Loops**

```python
[(x, y) for x in [1, 2] for y in [3, 4]]
# Output: [(1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4)]
```

Equivalent to:

```python
result = []
for x in [1, 2]:
    for y in [3, 4]:
        result.append((x, y))
```

‚û°Ô∏è Inner loop comes after outer loop, just like nested `for` statements.

### üîç Best Practices

#### ‚úÖ 1. **Keep It Readable**

List comprehensions are great, but **don't sacrifice readability**. If the logic becomes complex, **use regular loops**.

#### ‚úÖ 2. **Avoid Side Effects**

List comprehensions are meant to return a new list, not to do something like printing or updating external state:

```python
# ‚ùå Bad:
[print(x) for x in items]

# ‚úÖ Better:
for x in items:
    print(x)
```

#### ‚úÖ 3. **Use for Transformation or Filtering**

If your goal is to:

* transform each element ‚Üí use list comprehension.
* filter elements ‚Üí use list comprehension with `if`.

#### ‚úÖ 4. **Consider Alternatives for Large Data**

If you're dealing with huge data:

* Use **generators** (`()` instead of `[]`) to save memory:

```python
(x * 2 for x in large_iterable)
```

#### ‚úÖ 5. **Use Comprehensions with Dicts and Sets Too**

```python
# Set comprehension
{x for x in range(10) if x % 2 == 0}

# Dict comprehension
{k: k**2 for k in range(5)}
```

### üß† Practice Ideas to Build Intuition

* Rewrite 5 existing for-loops into list comprehensions.
* Try creating list comprehensions for:

  * Flattening a 2D list
  * Removing duplicates and sorting
  * Extracting and transforming values from dictionaries

No worries! Let's break it down super clearly ‚Äî you'll get it in no time.

### üß† **What is dictionary comprehension?**

It's similar to list comprehension, but it builds a dictionary instead of a list.

---

### üîß **Basic syntax**:

```python
{key_expr: value_expr for item in iterable if condition}
```

Just like list comprehension, but you're using `key: value` pairs.

---

### üëá Step-by-step for your problem:

You have:

```python
items = {"apple": 30, "banana": 10, "cherry": 50, "mango": 25}
```

You want:

* Only items with price > 20
* Convert price to USD by multiplying with 0.012

---

### ‚úÖ Dictionary comprehension:

```python
{k: v * 0.012 for k, v in items.items() if v > 20}
```

### üìò Explanation:

* `items.items()` gives pairs like `("apple", 30)`
* `k: v * 0.012` creates a new key-value with converted price
* `if v > 20` filters only expensive items

### üí° Output:

```python
{'apple': 0.36, 'cherry': 0.6, 'mango': 0.3}
```
