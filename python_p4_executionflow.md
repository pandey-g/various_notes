You're asking for a **complete mental model** of Python's **execution workflow** — from top to bottom, including **function calls, call stack, event loops, threads, and multiprocessing**. Let’s dive into this step-by-step, intuitively, and comprehensively.

# 🧠 How Python Executes Code — Complete Intuitive Breakdown

---

## 🟢 1. **Starting Point: Python Code is Just Text**

When you run:

```bash
python my_script.py
```

Python does the following:

1. **Loads your code**
2. **Parses it** into an Abstract Syntax Tree (AST)
3. **Compiles it** into Python **bytecode**
4. **Interprets** that bytecode using the **Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**

> 🔄 This is all handled by the CPython interpreter (the standard Python implementation).

---

## ⚙️ 2. **Execution Happens Inside the Python Virtual Machine (PVM)**

The PVM is a stack-based interpreter. When it sees something like:

```python
def greet():
    print("Hello")

greet()
```

It creates a **frame object** for the function call and pushes it onto the **call stack**.

---

## 📦 3. **Call Stack: The Core Execution Flow**

### Think of the call stack as a stack of "what we’re doing right now."

Example:

```python
def outer():
    inner()

def inner():
    print("Hi")

outer()
```

### What happens:

1. `outer()` is called → a frame for `outer` is pushed on the stack
2. Inside `outer()`, `inner()` is called → a frame for `inner` is pushed
3. Inside `inner()`, `print()` is called → another frame
4. When `print()` is done → it’s popped
5. Then `inner()` finishes → popped
6. Then `outer()` finishes → popped

> 📚 The call stack keeps track of **where in the code we are**, **local variables**, and **what to return to**.

---

## 🧵 4. **Threading: Parallelism via OS Threads**

Python supports **multithreading**:

```python
import threading

def task():
    print("Doing work")

thread = threading.Thread(target=task)
thread.start()
```

Here:

* Python tells the **OS** to create a new thread
* The OS scheduler decides **when each thread runs**
* Each thread has **its own call stack**

BUT...

🧠 **Due to the GIL (Global Interpreter Lock)**:

* Only **one thread** executes Python bytecode at a time
* Threads are still good for **I/O-bound tasks**, but not great for **CPU-bound work**

---

## 🔥 5. **Multiprocessing: Real Parallel CPU Execution**

For actual parallelism (especially for CPU-heavy work), Python uses **multiple processes**:

```python
from multiprocessing import Process

def compute():
    print("Heavy work")

p = Process(target=compute)
p.start()
```

This:

* Spawns a **new Python process**
* Each process has its own **memory space, interpreter, GIL, and call stack**
* So these run **truly in parallel** on multiple CPU cores

---

## 🌀 6. **Asyncio + Event Loop: Cooperative Concurrency**

Async is for managing **lots of I/O-bound work efficiently** on a single thread.

### Core idea:

* You define **coroutines** with `async def`
* You pause them with `await`
* An **event loop** keeps track of paused tasks and **resumes them when ready**

### Visual:

```python
async def download():
    print("Start")
    await asyncio.sleep(1)
    print("Done")
```

* On `await`, the coroutine **yields control**
* The **event loop** switches to another coroutine
* When the sleep is done, it resumes the first one

🧠 Asyncio is like one person juggling multiple tasks **without waiting around**.

## 🧮 7. **Where Do These Fit Together?**

| Component             | What It Manages        | When to Use                             |
| --------------------- | ---------------------- | --------------------------------------- |
| 🧠 Call Stack         | Tracks function calls  | Always — built-in                       |
| 🧵 Threading          | OS-managed threads     | For I/O-bound work, background jobs     |
| 🌀 Asyncio/Event Loop | Coroutine scheduling   | For high-performance I/O (web APIs, DB) |
| 🔥 Multiprocessing    | Real parallel CPU work | For CPU-heavy operations                |

## 🧠 Analogy: How They Work Together

Imagine Python is a **restaurant**:

* **Call Stack**: A single chef following one recipe at a time
* **Threading**: Multiple chefs, but only one can use the stove at a time (GIL)
* **Asyncio**: One chef juggling multiple orders by switching tasks while waiting
* **Multiprocessing**: Multiple kitchens working in parallel

---

## 🧠 Bonus: Behind-the-Scenes Summary

* Python code → parsed → compiled to bytecode → run by PVM
* Call stack keeps track of all function calls
* Async uses **event loop** for cooperative multitasking
* Threads are managed by the **OS**, but limited by the GIL
* Multiprocessing uses **OS-level processes** for real parallelism
