Sure! Let's go step-by-step.

# 🔥 **What is Torch?**

**Torch** is an open-source machine learning library originally developed in **Lua**. However, when people talk about "Torch" nowadays, they're usually referring to **PyTorch**, a Python-based library developed by **Facebook AI Research (FAIR)**. It has become one of the most widely used frameworks for machine learning, deep learning, and artificial intelligence.

## 🔸 **Core Features of PyTorch (Torch)**

| Feature                       | Description                                                                                            |
| ----------------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Tensor computation**        | Like NumPy but with GPU acceleration.                                                                  |
| **Dynamic computation graph** | Build computational graphs dynamically (eager execution) rather than statically (like TensorFlow 1.x). |
| **Deep learning support**     | Easy construction of neural networks via `torch.nn` module.                                            |
| **GPU Acceleration**          | Seamlessly move tensors and models between CPU and GPU.                                                |
| **Autograd**                  | Automatic differentiation for all operations on Tensors.                                               |
| **Pythonic interface**        | Feels like native Python, with flexibility and readability.                                            |

# 🔥 **Key Components of PyTorch**

---

## 1️⃣ **Tensors (torch.Tensor)**

* A tensor is a generalization of matrices to more dimensions.
* Equivalent to NumPy arrays but with GPU support.

```python
import torch

# Create a tensor
x = torch.tensor([1, 2, 3])
print(x)

# Random tensor of size 2x3
y = torch.rand(2, 3)
print(y)

# Tensor with zeros
z = torch.zeros(2, 3)
```

* **Move tensor to GPU:**

```python
x = x.to('cuda')  # Move to GPU
```

---

## 2️⃣ **Autograd (torch.autograd)**

* **Automatic differentiation engine**.
* Tracks operations on tensors to compute gradients for backpropagation.

```python
x = torch.tensor([2.0, 3.0], requires_grad=True)
y = x ** 2 + 3 * x

# Compute gradients
y_sum = y.sum()
y_sum.backward()

print(x.grad)  # Prints gradients: dy/dx
```

---

## 3️⃣ **Building Neural Networks (torch.nn)**

* `torch.nn.Module` is the base class for all neural networks.

```python
import torch.nn as nn

class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(2, 1)  # Linear layer

    def forward(self, x):
        return self.fc(x)

net = Net()
print(net)
```

---

## 4️⃣ **Optimization (torch.optim)**

* Provides various optimization algorithms like SGD, Adam, RMSprop.

```python
import torch.optim as optim

optimizer = optim.SGD(net.parameters(), lr=0.01)

# Sample training step
optimizer.zero_grad()    # Zero gradients
output = net(torch.tensor([[1.0, 2.0]]))
loss = (output - torch.tensor([[1.0]])).pow(2).sum()  # Dummy loss
loss.backward()          # Backpropagation
optimizer.step()         # Update parameters
```

---

## 5️⃣ **Data Loading (torch.utils.data)**

* Easier dataset handling.

```python
from torch.utils.data import DataLoader, TensorDataset

# Create a dataset
dataset = TensorDataset(torch.rand(100, 2), torch.rand(100, 1))

# Create DataLoader
loader = DataLoader(dataset, batch_size=10, shuffle=True)

for data, target in loader:
    print(data, target)
```

---

## 6️⃣ **CUDA and GPU Acceleration**

* Move models and data to GPU:

```python
device = torch.device('cuda' if torch.cuda.is_available() else 'cpu')
model = Net().to(device)
data = torch.rand(2, 2).to(device)
```

---

## 7️⃣ **TorchScript (Deployment)**

* Allows models to be serialized and run independently from Python.

```python
# Example
scripted_model = torch.jit.script(model)
scripted_model.save('model.pt')
```

---

# 🚀 **Common Use Cases of PyTorch**

* Deep Learning (CNNs, RNNs, Transformers)
* Computer Vision (object detection, image classification)
* Natural Language Processing (NLP)
* Reinforcement Learning
* Generative models (GANs, VAEs)

---

# 📦 **Ecosystem**

* **torchvision** – Image datasets, models, transforms.
* **torchaudio** – Audio processing.
* **torchtext** – NLP tools.
* **PyTorch Lightning** – Lightweight wrapper for cleaner code.
* **Hugging Face Transformers** – Massive library for NLP models built on PyTorch.

# 💡 **Example: Simple Neural Network for Classification**

```python
import torch
import torch.nn as nn
import torch.optim as optim

# Dataset
X = torch.rand(100, 2)
y = (X.sum(axis=1) > 1).float().unsqueeze(1)  # Label: 1 if sum > 1, else 0

# Model
class Net(nn.Module):
    def __init__(self):
        super(Net, self).__init__()
        self.fc = nn.Linear(2, 1)

    def forward(self, x):
        return torch.sigmoid(self.fc(x))

model = Net()

# Loss and optimizer
criterion = nn.BCELoss()
optimizer = optim.SGD(model.parameters(), lr=0.1)

# Training loop
for epoch in range(100):
    optimizer.zero_grad()
    outputs = model(X)
    loss = criterion(outputs, y)
    loss.backward()
    optimizer.step()

    if epoch % 10 == 0:
        print(f'Epoch {epoch} Loss {loss.item()}')

```

# 🔥 **Summary**

* **Torch = PyTorch (Python version of original Torch)**
* Designed for **flexibility**, **ease of debugging**, and **GPU acceleration**.
* Widely used in research, academia, and industry.
* Competes directly with TensorFlow but is often preferred for research and prototyping due to its simplicity and dynamic nature.
