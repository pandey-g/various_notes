The command you provided:

```bash
uvicorn src.app.main1:app --reload --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

is used to run a FastAPI (or Starlette) application using **Uvicorn**, an ASGI server. Here's a breakdown of what each part means:

### üîç Breakdown

| Part                | Explanation                                                                                                                                             |
| ------------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------- |
| `uvicorn`           | The ASGI server used to run the FastAPI app.                                                                                                            |
| `src.app.main1:app` | Tells Uvicorn where to find the FastAPI app instance. <br> - `src/app/main1.py` is the file path. <br> - Inside that file, `app` is the FastAPI object. |
| `--reload`          | Enables auto-reload. Useful for development ‚Äì it watches your code for changes and restarts the server automatically.                                   |
| `--host 0.0.0.0`    | Makes the server accessible from **outside** the local machine (i.e., reachable over a local network or Docker).                                        |
| `--port 8000`       | Sets the port number to **8000** (default FastAPI port).                                                                                                |

### ‚úÖ When to Use This

* During **local development**, especially if you're running the app in a Docker container or want access from other devices on your network.

### üõë Common Pitfalls

1. **File not found**:
   Make sure you have this structure:

   ```
   src/
     app/
       main1.py  ‚Üê contains `app = FastAPI()`
   ```

2. **NameError**:
   Make sure inside `main1.py`, you have:

   ```python
   from fastapi import FastAPI
   app = FastAPI()
   ```

3. **ModuleNotFoundError**:
   If `src` is not a package or not in your Python path, use:

   ```bash
   PYTHONPATH=. uvicorn src.app.main1:app --reload
   ```

Would you like help setting up your `main1.py` file or running this inside Docker or with Poetry?
