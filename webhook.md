A **webhook** is a way for one application (a server or service) to **automatically send real-time data to another application** when a specific event occurs. It's a **"reverse API"**, meaning instead of the client making a request to the server, the server pushes data to the client.

### üîÅ Basic Flow of a Webhook

1. **Client (your application) registers a webhook**:

   * You give your app's URL (e.g., `https://myapp.com/webhook`) to another system (like Stripe, GitHub, or Shopify).
   * You tell them what events you're interested in (e.g., "payment successful", "repository push").

2. **Event occurs on the source system**:

   * For example, someone makes a payment on Stripe.

3. **Source system sends an HTTP POST request** to your webhook URL:

   * The payload (body) contains data about the event (e.g., amount paid, user ID).

4. **Your server receives this POST** and processes the event:

   * You might store the payment in your DB, send a confirmation email, etc.

### üß† Webhooks vs APIs

| Feature       | API                          | Webhook                          |
| ------------- | ---------------------------- | -------------------------------- |
| Who initiates | Client                       | Server (source of events)        |
| How           | You make requests (GET/POST) | You receive POST requests        |
| When          | On-demand                    | Automatically, when event occurs |
| Use case      | Request data when needed     | React to events in real time     |

### üîß Real-Life Analogy

Imagine you go to a restaurant and give your number to the host to notify you when your table is ready:

* **Webhook = the restaurant calls you (your phone number is the webhook URL)**
* **API = you keep going to the host and asking, "Is my table ready?"**

---

### ‚úÖ When to Use Webhooks

* **Receiving payment confirmations** (e.g., Stripe, Razorpay)
* **Real-time notifications** (e.g., GitHub push events, CI build status)
* **Third-party integrations** (e.g., Slack slash commands, Shopify orders)

---

### üì¶ Example: Stripe Webhook

1. You register a webhook: `https://myapp.com/stripe/webhook`
2. A customer makes a payment.
3. Stripe sends a POST request like:

```http
POST /stripe/webhook HTTP/1.1
Content-Type: application/json

{
  "event": "payment_intent.succeeded",
  "data": {
    "id": "pi_123456",
    "amount": 1000,
    "currency": "usd",
    ...
  }
}
```

4. Your server handles this: logs the event, updates the database, etc.

### üîê Security Best Practices

* **Verify signatures**: Most webhook providers (like Stripe) include a secret key header to validate the request.
* **Use HTTPS**: Always encrypt webhook endpoints.
* **Throttle and retry**: Be ready to handle multiple deliveries (in case of failure) and prevent abuse.
* **Respond with `2xx` status**: This tells the sender you received and processed the webhook.

---

### üöÄ Building a Webhook Endpoint (FastAPI example)

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/webhook")
async def webhook_endpoint(request: Request):
    payload = await request.json()
    print("Received event:", payload)
    return {"status": "ok"}
```

---

### üß™ Testing Tools

* [Webhook.site](https://webhook.site): Temporary public URL to inspect webhook requests.
* [Ngrok](https://ngrok.com): Tunnel your localhost to the internet for testing webhooks.

### Summary

| Concept       | Description                               |
| ------------- | ----------------------------------------- |
| Trigger       | Event happens in a service (e.g., GitHub) |
| Action        | That service sends a POST to your URL     |
| Purpose       | Real-time updates, automation             |
| Protocol      | HTTP POST with JSON                       |
| Key Advantage | No polling, real-time, scalable           |

Let me know if you want to build a webhook receiver for a specific use case (e.g., Stripe, GitHub, Zoom, Razorpay).
