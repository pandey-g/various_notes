Great question!

## 🔔 What Are **Webhooks**?

**Webhooks** are a way for one application to **send real-time data** to another application **when an event happens**, using **HTTP callbacks**.

In simple terms:

> ❝ A webhook is like a **doorbell** — when an event happens, the sender rings the bell (makes an HTTP request) to your provided URL. ❞

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

* **Push-based**: Unlike polling, you don’t ask for data repeatedly — the server **pushes** it to you.
* **Triggered by events**: Something happens (e.g., payment received, user signed up), and the system automatically **calls your endpoint** (e.g., `POST https://yourapp.com/webhook`) with relevant data.
* Uses regular **HTTP POST requests**
* Common in services like:

  * Stripe (payment completed)
  * GitHub (new PR, push event)
  * Slack (message posted)
  * Shopify (order placed)

---

## 🔁 How It Works (Step-by-Step)

### Scenario: Stripe sends payment updates to your app

1. **You register your webhook URL** on Stripe’s dashboard:
   `https://yourapp.com/webhooks/stripe`

2. **An event occurs** (e.g., a customer completes payment)

3. **Stripe sends** an HTTP `POST` request to your webhook:

   ```http
   POST /webhooks/stripe HTTP/1.1
   Content-Type: application/json
   User-Agent: Stripe/1.0

   {
     "event": "payment_succeeded",
     "amount": 5000,
     "currency": "USD",
     "customer_id": "cus_ABC123"
   }
   ```

4. **Your app receives** the request, verifies it, and processes the data.

5. **You return `200 OK`** to confirm you received it.

## 🧪 Example Webhook in FastAPI

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/webhooks/stripe")
async def stripe_webhook(request: Request):
    payload = await request.json()
    event_type = payload.get("event")
    print(f"Received Stripe event: {event_type}")
    return {"status": "received"}
```

---

## 🔐 Webhook Security (Important)

Since anyone can post to your endpoint, you should secure it:

* **Verify signatures**: Many platforms (like Stripe, GitHub) sign their payloads.
* **Use secret tokens**: Include a shared secret header (`X-Signature`, `X-Hub-Signature`)
* **Whitelist IPs** (sometimes)
* **Rate limit** and log webhook activity

## 🆚 Webhook vs API Polling

| Feature        | Webhook                    | Polling                           |
| -------------- | -------------------------- | --------------------------------- |
| Trigger        | Event-driven (push)        | Client asks repeatedly            |
| Latency        | Real-time                  | Delayed (depends on polling rate) |
| Resource usage | Efficient (only on events) | Inefficient                       |
| Complexity     | Requires endpoint/server   | Easier for simple needs           |

---

## 🔔 Common Webhook Use Cases

| App / Service | Webhook Example Event                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------- |
| Stripe        | Payment succeeded                     |
| GitHub        | Push, PR, or issue created            |
| Slack         | Message posted to a channel           |
| Zoom          | Meeting started or ended              |
| Shopify       | Order created, fulfilled, or refunded |

## 🧠 Summary

| Property  | Value                                           |
| --------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| Type      | HTTP POST callback                              |
| Direction | Server → Your app                               |
| Trigger   | Events (not manual request)                     |
| Payload   | Usually JSON                                    |
| Transport | HTTP (often with `application/json`)            |
| Security  | Signature verification, tokens, IP whitelisting |
| Use case  | Real-time updates, integration, automation      |

Would you like help building or testing a webhook in **FastAPI**, **ngrok**, or connecting it to services like GitHub or Stripe?


***<----------------------------------------How would some one subscribe on a server to get webhook responses ?------------------------------------------------>***

Great question!

To **receive webhook responses** (i.e. "subscribe" to webhook events), **you don't subscribe from your own server** — instead, you **register your server's endpoint URL** with the **provider** (e.g., GitHub, Stripe, etc.) — they are the ones who send the webhooks.

---

## 🔁 Understanding the Roles:

| Role               | Who                             | What They Do                                    |
| ------------------ | ------------------------------- | ----------------------------------------------- |
| **Sender**         | e.g., Stripe, GitHub            | Sends `POST` requests when events occur         |
| **Receiver** (You) | Your FastAPI/Django/Node server | Hosts an HTTP endpoint to receive those `POST`s |

You **subscribe by telling the sender:**

> “When *this event* happens, call *this URL* on my server.”

---

## ✅ How to Subscribe to a Webhook (Steps)

### 🔹 Step 1: Expose a Public URL

You need a public HTTP endpoint, e.g., `https://yourdomain.com/webhooks/github`.

* If you’re developing locally, use **[ngrok](https://ngrok.com)** to expose it:

```bash
ngrok http 8000
```

It gives you a public URL like: `https://abc123.ngrok.io/webhooks/github`

---

### 🔹 Step 2: Register Your Webhook URL With the Provider

**Where and how you register depends on the provider.**

#### 🧾 Example: GitHub

Go to your repo → **Settings** → **Webhooks** → Add webhook:

* **Payload URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/webhooks/github`
* **Content type**: `application/json`
* **Secret** (optional but recommended): e.g. `supersecret123`
* **Events**: Push, PR, etc.

#### 🧾 Example: Stripe

Go to **Developers → Webhooks → Add endpoint**

* **Endpoint URL**: `https://yourdomain.com/webhooks/stripe`
* **Events**: `payment_intent.succeeded`, etc.

---

### 🔹 Step 3: Implement the Receiving Endpoint

#### Example in FastAPI:

```python
from fastapi import FastAPI, Request, Header

app = FastAPI()

@app.post("/webhooks/stripe")
async def stripe_webhook(request: Request, stripe_signature: str = Header(None)):
    payload = await request.body()
    # (optional) verify signature with secret
    print("Received Stripe payload:", payload)
    return {"received": True}
```

---

### 🔹 Step 4: Acknowledge the Webhook

You must respond with **HTTP 200 OK** or **the sender may retry** the delivery.

---

### 🔐 Bonus: Signature Verification

To secure your endpoint, verify the webhook is **really from the provider**:

* Stripe uses: `Stripe-Signature`
* GitHub uses: `X-Hub-Signature-256`
* Many services let you configure a **shared secret**

Example (simplified):

```python
import hmac, hashlib

def verify_signature(payload, secret, header_sig):
    expected_sig = hmac.new(
        secret.encode(), payload, hashlib.sha256
    ).hexdigest()
    return hmac.compare_digest(f"sha256={expected_sig}", header_sig)
```

### 🔁 Summary: How to Subscribe to Webhooks

| Step | What You Do                                 |
| ---- | ------------------------------------------- |
| 1    | Create a public URL (e.g., FastAPI + ngrok) |
| 2    | Register this URL with the external service |
| 3    | Write code to handle POST payloads          |
| 4    | Optionally verify the webhook signature     |
| 5    | Return 200 OK to acknowledge receipt        |
