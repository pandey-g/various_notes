***<-------------------what is SDK and how it is different from framework , library and APIs------------------->***


Great question! These terms‚Äî**SDK**, **framework**, **library**, and **API**‚Äîall show up frequently in software development, and it's very common to get confused among them. Let‚Äôs break them down with simple definitions and analogies so you can clearly understand how they're different:

---

### 1. **API (Application Programming Interface)**

* Think of an **API** as a *menu* in a restaurant.
* It tells you what functions are available and how to use them, but you still cook (write) your own code.
* It‚Äôs basically a **set of rules, methods, or endpoints** offered by something (like a service or a library) that you can call from your code.

‚û°Ô∏è **You use an API to communicate with an external system or with a library.**

---

### 2. **Library**

* A **library** is a collection of pre-written code that you can call to perform tasks.
* You are still in control. You decide **when and how** to use the library functions.
* Example: NumPy in Python ‚Äî you import and call specific functions whenever you need.

‚û°Ô∏è **A library gives you reusable code, but you control the flow.**

---

### 3. **Framework**

* A **framework** provides a structure for your entire application.
* It calls **your code** at specific places (this is called *inversion of control*).
* You fill in certain pieces, but the framework controls the overall flow.
* Example: Django or React ‚Äî you write code inside the framework‚Äôs structure, and the framework decides when your code is executed.

‚û°Ô∏è **With a framework, the framework is in control‚Äîyou fill in the blanks.**

---

### 4. **SDK (Software Development Kit)**

* An **SDK** is like a **toolbox**: it often includes APIs, libraries, documentation, tools, code samples, sometimes even frameworks!
* Its purpose is to help you build applications for a specific platform.

Example:

* Android SDK = tools + emulator + APIs + libraries to build Android apps.
* AWS SDK = packaged libraries and APIs to work with AWS in various programming languages.

‚û°Ô∏è **An SDK is a full package of tools to build something on a specific platform.** It can contain APIs and libraries.

### Summary Table

| Term          | What it is                                           | Who controls the flow?        |
| ------------- | ---------------------------------------------------- | ----------------------------- |
| **API**       | Interface/specification                              | You                           |
| **Library**   | Reusable code collection                             | You                           |
| **Framework** | Skeleton + Inversion of control                      | Framework                     |
| **SDK**       | Complete toolkit (may include APIs, libraries, etc.) | You (but with tools provided) |

### Simple Analogy:

| Item          | Analogy in Cooking                                                 |
| ------------- | ------------------------------------------------------------------ |
| **Library**   | Pre-made sauce ‚Äì you choose when to add it                         |
| **API**       | Recipe instructions telling you how to call a service              |
| **Framework** | Meal kit subscription ‚Äì they give structure and call your steps    |
| **SDK**       | Full kitchen starter kit: utensils + recipes + ingredients + tools |

---

### TL;DR

* **API** = How to talk to something.
* **Library** = A set of reusable functions you call.
* **Framework** = A structure that calls your code.
* **SDK** = A full bundle of tools & libraries to build apps for a platform.
